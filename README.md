| **[Polymer-Agent: Large Language Model Agent for Polymer Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16376v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-demand Polymer discovery is essential for various industries, ranging from biomedical to reinforcement materials. Experiments with polymers have a long trial-and-error process, leading to use of extensive resources. For these processes, machine learning has accelerated scientific discovery at the property prediction and latent space search fronts. However, laboratory researchers cannot readily access codes and these models to extract individual structures and properties due to infrastructure limitations. We present a closed-loop polymer structure-property predictor integrated in a terminal for early-stage polymer discovery. The framework is powered by LLM reasoning to provide users with property prediction, property-guided polymer structure generation, and structure modification capabilities. The SMILES sequences are guided by the synthetic accessibility score and the synthetic complexity score (SC Score) to ensure that polymer generation is as close as possible to synthetically accessible monomer-level structures. This framework addresses the challenge of generating novel polymer structures for laboratory researchers, thereby providing computational insights into polymer research.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphSeek: Next-Generation Graph Analytics with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11052v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are foundational across domains but remain hard to use without deep expertise. LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Explore with Parameter-Space Noise: A Deep Dive into Parameter-Space Noise for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02555v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves LLM reasoning, yet growing evidence indicates an exploration ceiling: it often reweights existing solution traces rather than discovering new strategies, limiting gains under large sampling budgets (e.g., pass-at-256). We address this limitation with PSN-RLVR, which perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation to induce temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration that better preserves long-horizon chain-of-thought coherence than action-space noise. To mitigate the resulting sampling-update mismatch, we incorporate truncated importance sampling (TIS). To avoid expensive KL-based adaptive noise control, we propose a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by a lightweight surrogate that combines semantic diversity with normalized self-certainty. Instantiated on GRPO, a widely used RLVR method, PSN-GRPO consistently expands the effective reasoning capability boundary across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods (e.g., Pass-at-k-style training) while remaining orthogonal and thus composable for additional gains.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 Figures |
| **[Fixing the Broken Compass: Diagnosing and Improving Inference-Time Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05188v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time scaling techniques have shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While recent research has primarily focused on training-time optimization, our work highlights inference-time reward model (RM)-based reasoning as a critical yet overlooked avenue. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of RM behavior across downstream reasoning tasks, revealing three key limitations: (1) RM can impair performance on simple questions, (2) its discriminative ability declines with increased sampling, and (3) high search diversity undermines RM performance. To address these issues, we propose CRISP (Clustered Reward Integration with Stepwise Prefixing), a novel inference-time algorithm that clusters generated reasoning paths by final answers, aggregates reward signals at the cluster level, and adaptively updates prefix prompts to guide generation. Experimental results demonstrate that CRISP significantly enhances LLM reasoning performance, achieving up to 5% accuracy improvement over other RM-based inference methods and an average of 10% gain over advanced reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 30 figures, Accpeted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcing Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Self-Evolving Rubrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10885v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite chain-of-thought (CoT) playing crucial roles in LLM reasoning, directly rewarding it is difficult: training a reward model demands heavy human labeling efforts, and static RMs struggle with evolving CoT distributions and reward hacking. These challenges motivate us to seek an autonomous CoT rewarding approach that requires no human annotation efforts and can evolve gradually. Inspired by recent self-evolving training methods, we propose \textbf{RLCER} (\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{C}oT Supervision via Self-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{R}ubrics), which enhances the outcome-centric RLVR by rewarding CoTs with self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics. We show that self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision signals even without outcome rewards, enabling RLCER to outperform outcome-centric RLVR. Moreover, when used as in-prompt hints, these self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.</p></details> | 21 pages |

We propose Macaron, a template-first benchmark that factorizes reasoning type and cultural aspect across question languages. Using 100 language-agnostic templates that cover 7 reasoning types, 22 cultural aspects, native annotators create scenario-aligned English and local-language multiple-choice questions and systematically derived True/False questions. Macaron contains 11,862 instances spanning 20 countries/cultural contexts, 10 scripts, and 20 languages (including low-resource ones like Amharic, Yoruba, Zulu, Kyrgyz, and some Arabic dialects). In zero-shot evaluation of 21 multilingual LLMs, reasoning-mode models achieve the strongest performance and near-parity between English and local languages, while open-weight models degrade substantially in local languages and often approach chance on T/F tasks. Culture-grounded mathematical and counting templates are consistently the hardest. The data can be accessed here https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlaaAhmed2444/Macaron.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advances in LLMs with Focus on Reasoning, Adaptability, Efficiency and Ethics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12365v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This survey paper outlines the key developments in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs), including enhancements to their reasoning skills, adaptability to various tasks, increased computational efficiency, and the ability to make ethical decisions. The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. A significant focus is placed on efficiency, detailing scaling strategies, optimization techniques, and the influential Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which strategically routes inputs to specialized subnetworks to boost predictive accuracy, while optimizing resource allocation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on recent advancements in LLMs, going beyond isolated aspects such as model architecture or ethical concerns. Additionally, it explores the role of LLMs in Agentic AI and their use as Autonomous Decision-Making Systems, and categorizes emerging methods that enhance LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. The survey also identifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made in LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks remain. Overcoming these requires a focus on bias mitigation, transparent decision-making, and explicit ethical guidelines. Future research will generally focus on enhancing the model's ability to handle multiple inputs, thereby making it more intelligent, safe, and reliable.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextBench: A Benchmark for Context Retrieval in Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05892v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Belief Entrenchment to Robust Reasoning in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16814v5)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising inference scaling method for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. However, it frequently suffers from belief entrenchment, where agents reinforce shared errors rather than correcting them. Going beyond merely identifying this failure, we decompose it into two distinct root causes: (1) the model's biased $\textit{static initial belief}$ and (2) $\textit{homogenized debate dynamics}$ that amplify the majority view regardless of correctness. To address these sequentially, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$. Our framework first rectifies the static belief via strategic prior knowledge elicitation, then reshapes the debate dynamics by enforcing perspective diversity. Validated on our new $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$ benchmark, $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly mitigates entrenchment, achieving a +9.5\% accuracy gain over ReAct prompting and a +19.0\% higher win rate than standard MAD.</p></details> | Accepted to TACL |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Reproduction of Networking Research Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21074v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reproduction is a cornerstone of scientific validity, yet it remains a formidable challenge in computer networking research due to the scarcity of open-source implementations and the complexity of heterogeneous system architectures. While Large Language Models have demonstrated potential in code generation, existing code generation frameworks often fail to address the long-context constraints and intricate logical dependencies required to reproduce network systems from academic papers. To facilitate result reproduction, we introduce \emph{RepLLM}, an end-to-end multi-agent framework designed to automate the transformation of network research into executable code. RepLLM features a novel collaborative architecture comprising four specialized agents -- Content Parsing, Architecture Design, Code Generation, and Audit \& Repair -- coordinated through an explicit \textit{Shared Memory} mechanism to ensure global context consistency. With the enhancement of Chain-of-Thought LLM reasoning and a sandbox-isolated static-dynamic debugging methodology, our framework effectively resolves semantic discrepancies and runtime errors. Extensive evaluations on representative papers from SIGCOMM and NSDI demonstrate that RepLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating compile-ready and logically correct systems. Results further demonstrate that RepLLM facilitates the reproduction of 80\% of the original benchmarks with only four hours of human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Reason Structurally? Benchmarking via the Lens of Data Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24069v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are deployed on increasingly complex tasks that require multi-step decision-making. Understanding their algorithmic reasoning abilities is therefore crucial. However, we lack a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating this capability. We propose data structures as a principled lens: as fundamental building blocks of algorithms, they naturally probe structural reasoning-the ability to understand and manipulate relationships such as order, hierarchy, and connectivity that underpin algorithmic reasoning. We introduce DSR-Bench, spanning 20 data structures, 35 operations, and 4,140 problem instances. DSR-Bench features hierarchical task organization, fully automated generation and evaluation, and fine-grained diagnostics. Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals critical limitations: the top-performing model achieves only 0.46/1 on challenging instances. Three auxiliary probes targeting more realistic usages expose further weaknesses: models perform poorly on spatial data and context-rich scenarios, and they struggle to reason over their own code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Power-SMC: Low-Latency Sequence-Level Power Sampling for Training-Free LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10273v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent reasoning gains in large language models can be explained as distribution sharpening: biasing generation toward high-likelihood trajectories already supported by the pretrained model, rather than modifying its weights. A natural formalization is the sequence-level power distribution $π_α(y\mid x)\propto p_θ(y\mid x)^α$ ($α>1$), which concentrates mass on whole sequences instead of adjusting token-level temperature. Prior work shows that Metropolis--Hastings (MH) sampling from this distribution recovers strong reasoning performance, but at order-of-magnitude inference slowdowns. We introduce Power-SMC, a training-free Sequential Monte Carlo scheme that targets the same objective while remaining close to standard decoding latency. Power-SMC advances a small particle set in parallel, corrects importance weights token-by-token, and resamples when necessary, all within a single GPU-friendly batched decode. We prove that temperature $τ=1/α$ is the unique prefix-only proposal minimizing incremental weight variance, interpret residual instability via prefix-conditioned Rényi entropies, and introduce an exponent-bridging schedule that improves particle stability without altering the target. On MATH500, Power-SMC matches or exceeds MH power sampling while reducing latency from $16$--$28\times$ to $1.4$--$3.3\times$ over baseline decoding.</p></details> |  |
| **[KORAL: Knowledge Graph Guided LLM Reasoning for SSD Operational Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10246v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solid State Drives (SSDs) are critical to datacenters, consumer platforms, and mission-critical systems. Yet diagnosing their performance and reliability is difficult because data are fragmented and time-disjoint, and existing methods demand large datasets and expert input while offering only limited insights. Degradation arises not only from shifting workloads and evolving architectures but also from environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and vibration. We present KORAL, a knowledge driven reasoning framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) to generate insights into SSD operations. Unlike traditional approaches that require extensive expert input and large datasets, KORAL generates a Data KG from fragmented telemetry and integrates a Literature KG that already organizes knowledge from literature, reports, and traces. This turns unstructured sources into a queryable graph and telemetry into structured knowledge, and both the Graphs guide the LLM to deliver evidence-based, explainable analysis aligned with the domain vocabulary and constraints. Evaluation using real production traces shows that the KORAL delivers expert-level diagnosis and recommendations, supported by grounded explanations that improve reasoning transparency, guide operator decisions, reduce manual effort, and provide actionable insights to improve service quality. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end system that combines LLMs and KGs for full-spectrum SSD reasoning including Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive, and What-if analysis. We release the generated SSD-specific KG to advance reproducible research in knowledge-based storage system analysis. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Damrl-lab/KORAL</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain of Mindset: Reasoning with Adaptive Cognitive Modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10063v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\% and 4.72\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency. Our code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/chain-of-mindset}{https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/chain-of-mindset}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamental Reasoning Paradigms Induce Out-of-Domain Generalization in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08658v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deduction, induction, and abduction are fundamental reasoning paradigms, core for human logical thinking. Although improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has attracted significant research efforts, the extent to which the fundamental paradigms induce generalization has yet to be systematically explored. In this study, we shed light on how the interplay between these core paradigms influences LLMs' reasoning behavior. To this end, we first collect a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks, each targeting one of the three fundamental paradigms, to abstract from concrete world knowledge. Then, we investigate effective ways for inducing these skills into LLMs. We experiment with a battery of methods including simple fine-tuning, and more complex approaches to increase model depth, or transform a dense model to a mixture-of-experts. We comprehensively evaluate induced models on realistic out-of-domain tasks, that are entirely formulated in natural language and contain real-world knowledge. Our results reveal that our approach yields strong generalizability with substantial performance gains (up to $14.60$) across realistic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Reasoning Predicts When Models Are Right: Evidence from Coding Classroom Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09832v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to automatically label and analyze educational dialogue at scale, yet current pipelines lack reliable ways to detect when models are wrong. We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCoTER: Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19514v5)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harnessing the reasoning power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommender systems is hindered by two fundamental challenges. First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a Generate-Validate-Mine (GVM) pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Empirically, experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements across diverse backbones. Moreover, in production deployment on the Tencent Advertising Platform, SCoTER achieved a 2.14\% lift in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) while eliminating online LLM inference costs. Overall, SCoTER presents a practical and unified framework for integrating structured LLM reasoning into recommender systems, validated by consistent improvements in both offline benchmarks and online production environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from the Irrecoverable: Error-Localized Policy Optimization for Tool-Integrated LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09598v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) enables LLM agents to solve tasks through planning, tool use, and iterative revision, but outcome-only reinforcement learning in this setting suffers from sparse, delayed rewards and weak step-level credit assignment. In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency. Our code will be publicly released soon.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

We ask how well they generalize. Evaluating six frameworks against 15 task classes drawn from peptide therapeutics, in vivo pharmacology, and resource-constrained settings, we find five capability gaps: no support for protein language models or peptide-specific prediction, no bridges between in vivo and in silico data, reliance on LLM inference with no pathway to ML training or reinforcement learning, assumptions tied to large-pharma resources, and single-objective optimization that ignores safety-efficacy-stability trade-offs. A paired knowledge-probing experiment suggests the bottleneck is architectural rather than epistemic: four frontier LLMs reason about peptides at levels comparable to small molecules, yet no framework exposes this capability. We propose design requirements and a capability matrix for next-generation frameworks that function as computational partners under realistic constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 8 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Grounded Dynamic Task Planning with Hierarchical Temporal Logic for Human-Aware Multi-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09472v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLM) enable non-experts to specify open-world multi-robot tasks, the generated plans often lack kinematic feasibility and are not efficient, especially in long-horizon scenarios. Formal methods like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offer correctness and optimal guarantees, but are typically confined to static, offline settings and struggle with computational scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in success rate and interaction fluency while minimizing planning latency.</p></details> |  |

| **[Data Repetition Beats Data Scaling in Long-CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11149v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Recovery in Reasoning Models Is Only a Few Early Steering Steps Away](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11096v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training for explicit chain-of-thought (e.g., GRPO) improves the reasoning ability of multimodal large-scale reasoning models (MLRMs). But recent evidence shows that it can simultaneously degrade safety alignment and increase jailbreak success rates. We propose SafeThink, a lightweight inference-time defense that treats safety recovery as a satisficing constraint rather than a maximization objective. SafeThink monitors the evolving reasoning trace with a safety reward model and conditionally injects an optimized short corrective prefix ("Wait, think safely") only when the safety threshold is violated. In our evaluations across six open-source MLRMs and four jailbreak benchmarks (JailbreakV-28K, Hades, FigStep, and MM-SafetyBench), SafeThink reduces attack success rates by 30-60% (e.g., LlamaV-o1: 63.33% to 5.74% on JailbreakV-28K, R1-Onevision: 69.07% to 5.65% on Hades) while preserving reasoning performance (MathVista accuracy: 65.20% to 65.00%). A key empirical finding from our experiments is that safety recovery is often only a few steering steps away: intervening in the first 1-3 reasoning steps typically suffices to redirect the full generation toward safe completions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is In-Context Learning Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10414v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue that, mathematically, ICL fits the definition of learning; however, its full characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that, empirically, ICL is limited in its ability to learn and generalise to unseen tasks. Namely, in the limit where exemplars become more numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity, especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied accuracies and on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding is not a robust mechanism for learning, and suggests limited all-purpose generalisability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026 -- CR version</p></details> |
| **[Conversational Behavior Modeling Foundation Model With Multi-Level Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11065v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human conversation is organized by an implicit chain of thoughts that manifests as timed speech acts. Capturing this perceptual pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that models this process as multi-level perception, and then reasons over conversational behaviors via a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |

We address this limitation with PSN-RLVR, which perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation to induce temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration that better preserves long-horizon chain-of-thought coherence than action-space noise. To mitigate the resulting sampling-update mismatch, we incorporate truncated importance sampling (TIS). To avoid expensive KL-based adaptive noise control, we propose a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by a lightweight surrogate that combines semantic diversity with normalized self-certainty. Instantiated on GRPO, a widely used RLVR method, PSN-GRPO consistently expands the effective reasoning capability boundary across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods (e.g., Pass-at-k-style training) while remaining orthogonal and thus composable for additional gains.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 Figures |

Existing methods mainly focus on general preference assessment, training models with large-scale data to tackle well-defined tasks such as text-image alignment. However, these approaches struggle to handle personalized preference because user-specific data are scarce and not easily scalable, and individual tastes are often diverse and complex. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a common preference profile that serves as a bridge across users, allowing large-scale user data to be leveraged for training profile prediction and capturing complex personalized preferences. Building on this idea, we propose a reasoning-based personalized image preference assessment framework that follows a \textit{predict-then-assess} paradigm: it first predicts a user's preference profile from reference images, and then provides interpretable, multi-dimensional scores and assessments of candidate images based on the predicted profile. To support this, we first construct a large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-style personalized assessment dataset annotated with diverse user preference profiles and high-quality CoT-style reasoning, enabling explicit supervision of structured reasoning. Next, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to empower the model with structured reasoning capabilities, followed by reinforcement learning to incentivize the model to explore more reasonable assessment paths and enhance generalization. Furthermore, we propose a similarity-aware prediction reward to encourage better prediction of the user's preference profile, which facilitates more reasonable assessments exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcing Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Self-Evolving Rubrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10885v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite chain-of-thought (CoT) playing crucial roles in LLM reasoning, directly rewarding it is difficult: training a reward model demands heavy human labeling efforts, and static RMs struggle with evolving CoT distributions and reward hacking. These challenges motivate us to seek an autonomous CoT rewarding approach that requires no human annotation efforts and can evolve gradually. Inspired by recent self-evolving training methods, we propose \textbf{RLCER} (\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{C}oT Supervision via Self-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{R}ubrics), which enhances the outcome-centric RLVR by rewarding CoTs with self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics. We show that self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision signals even without outcome rewards, enabling RLCER to outperform outcome-centric RLVR. Moreover, when used as in-prompt hints, these self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse Chains of Thought Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21124v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only 10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.</p></details> |  |

Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

Decision trees such as CART provide clear and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable decision paths.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing VCoT approaches are largely confined to static scenarios and struggle to capture the temporal dynamics essential for tasks such as instruction, prediction, and camera motion. To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

We explore the resolution of the long-standing sharp growth rate conjecture in Schauder theory, achieved by Cristiana De Filippis and Giuseppe Mingione, which identifies the exact threshold $q/p < 1 + α/n$ for gradient Hölder continuity. Central to this mathematical achievement is the ``ghost equation'' methodology, a sophisticated auxiliary derivation that bypasses the non-differentiability of classical Euler-Lagrange systems. We propose that the next era of mathematical discovery lies in the integration of these pure analytical constructs with LRMs grounded in topos theory and formal verification frameworks such as Safe and Typed Chain-of-Thought (PC-CoT). By modeling the reasoning process as a categorical colimit in a slice topos, we demonstrate how LRMs can autonomously navigate the ``Dark Side'' of the calculus of variations, providing machine-checkable proofs for regularity bounds in complex, multi-phase physical systems.</p></details> |  |

However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Despite substantial methodological progress, current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and \textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$ recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark. \ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion, we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional intelligence in the future.</p></details> |  |

However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environment. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs, reasoning techniques (e.g., GEPA, chain-of-thought, reflection) and competitive baseline PReP significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path(VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing city-scale cognitive maps (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLM, substantially enhancing navigation success.

The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. A significant focus is placed on efficiency, detailing scaling strategies, optimization techniques, and the influential Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which strategically routes inputs to specialized subnetworks to boost predictive accuracy, while optimizing resource allocation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on recent advancements in LLMs, going beyond isolated aspects such as model architecture or ethical concerns. Additionally, it explores the role of LLMs in Agentic AI and their use as Autonomous Decision-Making Systems, and categorizes emerging methods that enhance LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. The survey also identifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made in LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks remain. Overcoming these requires a focus on bias mitigation, transparent decision-making, and explicit ethical guidelines. Future research will generally focus on enhancing the model's ability to handle multiple inputs, thereby making it more intelligent, safe, and reliable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Canvas-of-Thought: Grounding Reasoning via Mutable Structured States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10494v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), relying solely on linear text sequences remains a bottleneck for complex tasks. We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the "ground truth". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone. Extensive experiments on VCode, RBench-V, and MathVista demonstrate that Canvas-CoT significantly outperforms existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for context-efficient multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Block Diffusion Language Models for Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09555v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in block diffusion language models have demonstrated competitive performance and strong scalability on reasoning tasks. However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models have demonstrated potential in code generation, existing code generation frameworks often fail to address the long-context constraints and intricate logical dependencies required to reproduce network systems from academic papers. To facilitate result reproduction, we introduce \emph{RepLLM}, an end-to-end multi-agent framework designed to automate the transformation of network research into executable code. RepLLM features a novel collaborative architecture comprising four specialized agents -- Content Parsing, Architecture Design, Code Generation, and Audit \& Repair -- coordinated through an explicit \textit{Shared Memory} mechanism to ensure global context consistency. With the enhancement of Chain-of-Thought LLM reasoning and a sandbox-isolated static-dynamic debugging methodology, our framework effectively resolves semantic discrepancies and runtime errors. Extensive evaluations on representative papers from SIGCOMM and NSDI demonstrate that RepLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating compile-ready and logically correct systems. Results further demonstrate that RepLLM facilitates the reproduction of 80\% of the original benchmarks with only four hours of human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

| **[Stroke Lesions as a Rosetta Stone for Language Model Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04074v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet methods to verify which model components are truly necessary for language function remain limited. Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.</p></details> | 45 pages, 17 figures |

Existing data selection methods either build expensive gradient datastores or assign static scores from a weak proxy, largely ignoring evolving uncertainty, and thus missing a key source of LLM interpretability. We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Shared Geometry of Difficulty in Multilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12731v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting problem-difficulty in large language models (LLMs) refers to estimating how difficult a task is according to the model itself, typically by training linear probes on its internal representations. In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-SAM-LLM: Large Language Models as Causal Reasoners for Robust Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03585v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains. This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Self-reflection in Automated Qualitative Coding: Improving Text Annotation through Secondary LLM Critique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09905v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) allow for sophisticated qualitative coding of large datasets, but zero- and few-shot classifiers can produce an intolerable number of errors, even with careful, validated prompting. We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.</p></details> |  |

This benchmark uses a dynamic game-like framework to test LLMs ability to mimic human cognitive processes through word associations. By simulating complex human interactions, it assesses how LLMs interpret and align with human thought patterns during conversational exchanges, which are essential for effective social partnerships in HCI. Initial findings highlight the influence of model sophistication on performance, offering insights into the models capabilities to engage in meaningful social interactions and adapt behaviors in human-like ways. This research advances the understanding of LLMs potential to replicate or diverge from human cognitive functions, paving the way for more nuanced and empathetic human-machine collaborations.</p></details> |  |

Yet the extent to which these models align with human judgments in interpreting figurative and socially grounded language remains uncertain. To investigate this, human participants and four instruction-tuned LLMs of different sizes (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, and Mistral-7B) rated 240 dialogue-based sentences representing six linguistic traits: conventionality, sarcasm, funny, emotional, idiomacy, and slang. Each of the 240 sentences was paired with 40 interpretive questions, and both humans and LLMs rated these sentences on a 10-point Likert scale. Results indicated that humans and LLMs aligned at the surface level with humans, but diverged significantly at the representational level, especially in interpreting figurative sentences involving idioms and Gen Z slang. GPT-4 most closely approximates human representational patterns, while all models struggle with context-dependent and socio-pragmatic expressions like sarcasm, slang, and idiomacy.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce a Neuro-Symbolic Compliance Framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to enable formal verifiability and optimization-based compliance correction. The LLM interprets statutes and enforcement cases to generate SMT constraints, while the solver enforces consistency and computes the minimal factual modification required to restore legality when penalties arise. Unlike transparency-oriented methods, our approach emphasizes logic-driven optimization, delivering verifiable, legally consistent reasoning rather than post-hoc explanation. Evaluated on 87 enforcement cases from Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), the system attains 86.2% correctness in SMT code generation, improves reasoning efficiency by over 100x, and consistently corrects violations-establishing a preliminary foundation for optimization-based compliance applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 tables, 3 figures, accepted by the 2nd ACM AIware Conference</p></details> |
| **[LLM Interpretability with Identifiable Temporal-Instantaneous Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23323v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling, instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Control with Large Language Models for Language-Guided Spatial Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17321v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have recently become effective tools for language-conditioned control in embodied systems, instability, slow convergence, and hallucinated actions continue to limit their direct application to continuous control. A modular neuro-symbolic control framework that clearly distinguishes between low-level motion execution and high-level semantic reasoning is proposed in this work. While a lightweight neural delta controller performs bounded, incremental actions in continuous space, a locally deployed LLM interprets symbolic tasks. We assess the suggested method in a planar manipulation setting with spatial relations between objects specified by language. Numerous tasks and local language models, such as Mistral, Phi, and LLaMA-3.2, are used in extensive experiments to compare LLM-only control, neural-only control, and the suggested LLM+DL framework. In comparison to LLM-only baselines, the results show that the neuro-symbolic integration consistently increases both success rate and efficiency, achieving average step reductions exceeding 70% and speedups of up to 8.83x while remaining robust to language model quality. The suggested framework enhances interpretability, stability, and generalization without any need of reinforcement learning or costly rollouts by controlling the LLM to symbolic outputs and allocating uninterpreted execution to a neural controller trained on artificial geometric data. These outputs show empirically that neuro-symbolic decomposition offers a scalable and principled way to integrate language understanding with ongoing control, this approach promotes the creation of dependable and effective language-guided embodied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trust Me, I Know This Function: Hijacking LLM Static Analysis using Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17361v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA). We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective against basic and reasoning models, but are also transferable across model families (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), and universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of code-oriented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verification-Guided Context Optimization for Tool Calling via Hierarchical LLMs-as-Editors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13860v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external environments through tool invocation, providing a practical way to overcome the limitations of pretraining. However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Workshop on Agentic AI Benchmarks and Applications for Enterprise Tasks</p></details> |
| **[Visualizing token importance for black-box language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11573v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of auditing black-box large language models (LLMs) to ensure they behave reliably when deployed in production settings, particularly in high-stakes domains such as legal, medical, and regulatory compliance. Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cache What Lasts: Token Retention for Memory-Bounded KV Cache in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03324v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory and computation remain core bottlenecks in long-horizon LLM inference due to the quadratic cost of self-attention and the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training. Our code and data will be open source to encourage future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 main.

A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness. Compared with prior LLM-based systems, CoMuRoS uniquely demonstrates runtime, event-driven replanning on physical robots, delivering robust, flexible multi-robot and human-robot collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

This project proposes an interdisciplinary study of linguistic errors produced by native Spanish speakers, with the aim of analyzing how current large language models (LLM) interpret, reproduce, or correct them. The research integrates three core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand the nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within real-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing (NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A purpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as the foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI models such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their ability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior. The project contributes not only to the understanding of Spanish as a native language but also to the development of NLP systems that are more cognitively informed and capable of engaging with the imperfect, variable, and often ambiguous nature of real human language.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Computing Conditional Shapley Values Using Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09489v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapley values have become a cornerstone of explainable AI, but they are computationally expensive to use, especially when features are dependent. Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime. We discuss further improvements and how tabular foundation models can be better adapted specifically for conditional Shapley value estimation.</p></details> |  |

This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models. Previous studies demonstrating successful XAI application should be reevaluated with respect to a possibly spurious concurrency of feature salience and informativeness, and workflows using feature attribution methods as building blocks should be scrutinised.</p></details> |  |

We recorded a new dataset (HLS-CMDS) and developed several AI models, including generative AI methods based on large language models (LLMs) for guided separation, explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret latent representations, variational autoencoders (VAEs) for waveform separation, a chemistry-inspired non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for clustering, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to detect abnormal physiological patterns. The performance of these AI models depends on the quality of the recorded signals. Therefore, this thesis also reviews the biosensing technologies used to capture biomedical data. It summarizes developments in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) acoustic sensors and quantum biosensors, such as quantum dots and nitrogen-vacancy centers. It further outlines the transition from electronic integrated circuits (EICs) to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and early progress toward integrated quantum photonics (IQP) for chip-based biosensing. Together, these studies show how AI and next-generation sensors can support more intelligent diagnostic systems for future healthcare.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[From Features to Actions: Explainability in Traditional and Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06841v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

If this condition is not diagnosed in a timely manner and appropriately treated, it can lead to serious complications such as decreased consciousness, permanent neurological disabilities, or even death.The primary aim of this study is to detect the occurrence or non-occurrence of ICH, followed by determining the type of subdural hemorrhage (SDH). These tasks are framed as two separate binary classification problems. By adding two layers to the co-scale convolutional attention (CCA) classifier architecture, we introduce a novel approach for ICH detection. In the first layer, after extracting features from different slices of computed tomography (CT) scan images, we combine these features and select the 50 components that capture the highest variance in the data, considering them as informative features. We then assess the discriminative power of these features using the bootstrap forest algorithm, discarding those that lack sufficient discriminative ability between different classes. This algorithm explicitly determines the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, assisting us in developing an explainable AI model. The features feed into a boosting neural network as a latent feature space. In the second layer, we introduce a novel uncertainty-based fuzzy integral operator to fuse information from different CT scan slices. This operator, by accounting for the dependencies between consecutive slices, significantly improves detection accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Open Source Software Sustainability with Deep Temporal Neural Hierarchical Architectures and Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09064v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Source Software (OSS) projects follow diverse lifecycle trajectories shaped by evolving patterns of contribution, coordination, and community engagement. Understanding these trajectories is essential for stakeholders seeking to assess project organization and health at scale. However, prior work has largely relied on static or aggregated metrics, such as project age or cumulative activity, providing limited insight into how OSS sustainability unfolds over time. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical predictive framework that models OSS projects as belonging to distinct lifecycle stages grounded in established socio-technical categorizations of OSS development. Rather than treating sustainability solely as project longevity, these lifecycle stages operationalize sustainability as a multidimensional construct integrating contribution activity, community participation, and maintenance dynamics. The framework combines engineered tabular indicators with 24-month temporal activity sequences and employs a multi-stage classification pipeline to distinguish lifecycle stages associated with different coordination and participation regimes. To support transparency, we incorporate explainable AI techniques to examine the relative contribution of feature categories to model predictions. Evaluated on a large corpus of OSS repositories, the proposed approach achieves over 94\% overall accuracy in lifecycle stage classification. Attribution analyses consistently identify contribution activity and community-related features as dominant signals, highlighting the central role of collective participation dynamics.</p></details> |  |

The aim of this work is to form a comprehensive understanding of groundwater salinization underlying causal factors and identify important meteorological, geological and anthropogenic drivers of salinity. We have integrated different datasets of potential covariates, to create a robust framework for machine learning based predictive models including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), convolution neural network (CNN) and linear regression (LR), of groundwater salinity. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) followed by Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Explainable AI (XAI) based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to estimate the importance scores and find insights into the drivers of salinization. We also did causality analysis via Double machine learning using various predictive models. From these analyses, key meteorological (Precipitation, Temperature), geological (Distance from river, Distance to saline body, TWI, Shoreline distance), and anthropogenic (Area of agriculture field, Treated Wastewater) covariates are identified to be influential drivers of groundwater salinity across Israel. XAI analysis also identified Treated Wastewater (TWW) as an essential anthropogenic driver of salinity, its significance being context-dependent but critical in vulnerable hydro-climatic environment. Our approach provides deeper insight into global salinization mechanisms at country scale, reducing AI model uncertainty and highlighting the need for tailored strategies to address salinity.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 9 figures in main text and 6 figures in appendix, 2 tables, 3 Appendix</p></details> |

The focus of this work-in-progress is on outlining conceptual and technical foundations under which performance-makers and interactive architecture can collaborate within rehearsal settings. It introduces a rehearsal-oriented prototype system for shaping and testing AI-mediated environments within creative practice.

To answer this question, we examine the influence of BGD on EP across a sample of European firms from 2016 to 2022. Using panel regressions, advanced machine learning algorithms, and explainable AI, we reveal a non-linear relationship. Specifically, EP improves with BGD up to an optimal level of approximately 35 %, beyond which further increases in BGD yield no additional improvement in EP. A minimum BGD threshold of 22 % is necessary for meaningful improvements in EP. To assess the legitimacy of EP outcomes, this study examines whether ESG controversies weaken the BGD-EP relationship. The results show no significant effect, suggesting that BGD's impact is driven by governance mechanisms rather than symbolic actions. Additionally, path analysis indicates that while environmental innovation contributes to EP, it is not the mediating channel through which BGD promotes EP. The results have implications for academics, businesses, and regulators.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Explainable Transformer-Based Email Phishing Classification with Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12085v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing and related cyber threats are becoming more varied and technologically advanced. Among these, email-based phishing remains the most dominant and persistent threat. These attacks exploit human vulnerabilities to disseminate malware or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Deep learning (DL) models, particularly transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced phishing mitigation through their contextual understanding of language. However, some recent threats, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated phishing attacks, are reducing the overall system resilience of phishing detectors. In response, adversarial training has shown promise against AI-generated phishing threats. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and lighter version of the BERT transformer model for email classification. Robustness against text-based adversarial perturbations is reinforced using Fast Gradient Method (FGM) adversarial training. Furthermore, the framework integrates the LIME Explainable AI (XAI) technique to enhance the transparency of the DistilBERT architecture. The framework also uses the Flan-T5-small language model from Hugging Face to generate plain-language security narrative explanations for end-users. This combined approach ensures precise phishing classification while providing easily understandable justifications for the model's decisions.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a generative model that integrates effects of spatially-varying inputs and a network-valued input using deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear and spatial associations with the output. The method models spatial smoothness, accounts for subject heterogeneity and complex associations between network and spatial images at different scales, enables accurate inference of each images effect on the output image, and allows prediction with uncertainty quantification via Monte Carlo dropout, contributing to one of the first Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks for heterogeneous imaging data. The model is highly scalable to high-resolution data without the heavy pre-processing or summarization often required by Bayesian methods. Empirical results demonstrate its strong performance compared to existing statistical and deep learning methods. We applied the XAI model to the ABCD data which revealed associations between cortical features and ALFF throughout the entire brain. Our model performed comparably to existing methods in predictive accuracy but provided superior uncertainty quantification and faster computation, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale neuroimaging analysis. Open-source software in Python for XAI is available.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, most existing post-hoc explainability methods rely on class labels, making them unsuitable for label-free statistical testing settings. We propose an explainable deep statistical testing framework that augments deep two-sample tests with sample-level and feature-level explanations, revealing which individual samples and which input features drive statistically significant group differences. Our method highlights which image regions and which individual samples contribute most to the detected group difference, providing spatial and instance-wise insight into the test's decision. Applied to biomedical imaging data, the proposed framework identifies influential samples and highlights anatomically meaningful regions associated with disease-related variation. This work bridges statistical inference and explainable AI, enabling interpretable, label-free population analysis in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions. This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning. The study demonstrates the potential of integrated XAI techniques in improving the reliability and interpretability of AI systems in healthcare, particularly for critical tasks like brain tumour detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Explanations or Random Noise? A Reliability Metric for XAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05082v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.</p></details> |  |

On the Limits of Fidelity-Based Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12176v4)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In explainable AI, surrogate models are commonly evaluated by their fidelity to a neural network's predictions. Fidelity, however, measures alignment to a learned model rather than alignment to the data-generating signal underlying the task. This work introduces the linearity score $λ(f)$, a diagnostic that quantifies the extent to which a regression network's input--output behavior is linearly decodable. $λ(f)$ is defined as an $R^2$ measure of surrogate fit to the network. Across synthetic and real-world regression datasets, we find that surrogates can achieve high fidelity to a neural network while failing to recover the predictive gains that distinguish the network from simpler models. In several cases, high-fidelity surrogates underperform even linear baselines trained directly on the data. These results demonstrate that explaining a model's behavior is not equivalent to explaining the task-relevant structure of the data, highlighting a limitation of fidelity-based explanations when used to reason about predictive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

Infertility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risks are long-term complications that make early detection essential. In this paper, we design a powerful framework based on transfer learning utilizing DenseNet201 and ResNet50 for classifying ovarian ultrasound images. The model was trained on an online dataset containing 3856 ultrasound images of cyst-infected and non-infected patients. Each ultrasound frame was resized to 224x224 pixels and encoded with precise pathological indicators. The MixUp and CutMix augmentation strategies were used to improve generalization, yielding a peak validation accuracy of 99.80% by Densenet201 and a validation loss of 0.617 with alpha values of 0.25 and 0.4, respectively. We evaluated the model's interpretability using leading Explainable AI (XAI) approaches such as SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME, reasoning with and presenting explicit visual reasons for the model's behaviors, therefore increasing the model's transparency.

| **[Attention Consistency Regularization for Interpretable Early-Exit Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08891v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-exit neural networks enable adaptive inference by allowing predictions at intermediate layers, reducing computational cost. However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 2 pages, 1 figure |
| **[ShapBPT: Image Feature Attributions Using Data-Aware Binary Partition Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07047v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel-level feature attributions are an important tool in eXplainable AI for Computer Vision (XCV), providing visual insights into how image features influence model predictions. The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans.</p></details> | AAAI-2026 |

While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Make Everyone Happy?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11091v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the failure to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, leading to behaviors that diverge from human expectations in real-world settings where these dimensions must co-occur. Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication. Each prompt is paired with misaligned and aligned responses through two-stage rejection sampling to ensure quality. Second, we benchmark general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs on MISALIGNTRADE-revealing 12%-34% misalignment trade-offs across dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intrinsic Self-Correction in LLMs: Towards Explainable Prompting via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11924v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic self-correction refers to the phenomenon where a language model refines its own outputs purely through prompting, without external feedback or parameter updates. While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its mechanism remains unclear. We show that intrinsic self-correction functions by steering hidden representations along interpretable latent directions, as evidenced by both alignment analysis and activation interventions. To achieve this, we analyze intrinsic self-correction via the representation shift induced by prompting. In parallel, we construct interpretable latent directions with contrastive pairs and verify the causal effect of these directions via activation addition. Evaluating six open-source LLMs, our results demonstrate that prompt-induced representation shifts in text detoxification and text toxification consistently align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These findings suggest that representation steering is the mechanistic driver of intrinsic self-correction. Our analysis highlights that understanding model internals offers a direct route to analyzing the mechanisms of prompt-driven LLM behaviors.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Toward Faithful Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08892v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence, but faithfulness failures, where generations contradict or extend beyond the provided sources, remain a critical challenge. Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

We introduce Control Reinforcement Learning (CRL), which trains a policy to select SAE features for steering at each token, producing interpretable intervention logs: the learned policy identifies features that change model outputs when amplified. Adaptive Feature Masking encourages diverse feature discovery while preserving singlefeature interpretability. The framework yields new analysis capabilities: branch point tracking locates tokens where feature choice determines output correctness; critic trajectory analysis separates policy limitations from value estimation errors; layer-wise comparison reveals syntactic features in early layers and semantic features in later layers. On Gemma-2 2B across MMLU, BBQ, GSM8K, HarmBench, and XSTest, CRL achieves improvements while providing per-token intervention logs. These results establish learned feature steering as a mechanistic interpretability tool that complements static feature analysis with dynamic intervention probes</p></details> |  |

Yet most current biological foundation models focus only on single-cell resolution and are evaluated on technical metrics often disconnected from actual drug development tasks and challenges. Here, we introduce EVA, the first cross-species, multimodal foundation model of immunology and inflammation, a therapeutic area where shared pathogenic mechanisms create unique opportunities for transfer learning. EVA harmonizes transcriptomics data across species, platforms, and resolutions, and integrates histology data to produce rich, unified patient representations. We establish clear scaling laws, demonstrating that increasing model size and compute translates to improvements in both pretraining and downstream tasks performance. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite of 39 tasks spanning the drug development pipeline: zero-shot target efficacy and gene function prediction for discovery, cross-species or cross-diseases molecular perturbations for preclinical development, and patient stratification with treatment response prediction or disease activity prediction for clinical trials applications. We benchmark EVA against several state-of-the-art biological foundation models and baselines on these tasks, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on each task category. Using mechanistic interpretability, we further identify biological meaningful features, revealing intertwined representations across species and technologies. We release an open version of EVA for transcriptomics to accelerate research on immune-mediated diseases.</p></details> |  |

Using numerical analysis techniques, we rigorously quantify the accuracy, convergence rates, and generalization bounds of certain ML models applied to linear differential equations for parameter discovery or solution finding. Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. A similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for commonly used models, including physics-specific techniques. Counterintuitively, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also introduce a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for measuring generalization in physical systems, which can serve as a benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patches of Nonlinearity: Instruction Vectors in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07930v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent success of instruction-tuned language models and their ubiquitous usage, very little is known of how models process instructions internally. In this work, we address this gap from a mechanistic point of view by investigating how instruction-specific representations are constructed and utilized in different stages of post-training: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Via causal mediation, we identify that instruction representation is fairly localized in models. These representations, which we call Instruction Vectors (IVs), demonstrate a curious juxtaposition of linear separability along with non-linear causal interaction, broadly questioning the scope of the linear representation hypothesis commonplace in mechanistic interpretability. To disentangle the non-linear causal interaction, we propose a novel method to localize information processing in language models that is free from the implicit linear assumptions of patching-based techniques. We find that, conditioned on the task representations formed in the early layers, different information pathways are selected in the later layers to solve that task, i.e., IVs act as circuit selectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Transformers with Insights from Image Filtering and Boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10371v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.</p></details> |  |

We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $γ^* = 4.17 \times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility.

| **[The Quantum Sieve Tracer: A Hybrid Framework for Layer-Wise Activation Tracing in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06852v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer the internal computations of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet separating sparse semantic signals from high-dimensional polysemantic noise remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Quantum Sieve Tracer, a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to characterize factual recall circuits. We implement a modular pipeline that first localizes critical layers using classical causal tracing, then maps specific attention head activations into an exponentially large quantum Hilbert space. Using open-weight models (Meta Llama-3.2-1B and Alibaba Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct), we perform a two-stage analysis that reveals a fundamental architectural divergence. While Qwen's layer 7 circuit functions as a classic Recall Hub, we discover that Llama's layer 9 acts as an Interference Suppression circuit, where ablating the identified heads paradoxically improves factual recall. Our results demonstrate that quantum kernels can distinguish between these constructive (recall) and reductive (suppression) mechanisms, offering a high-resolution tool for analyzing the fine-grained topology of attention.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Feature Identification via the Empirical NTK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00468v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across three standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of Superposition (TMS), a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition and a 1-layer Transformer trained on modular addition, we find that top eigenspaces of the eNTK align with ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic, the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that the evolution of the eNTK spectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small models.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures. v2: references and expanded discussion in Appendix B added. v3: Transformer case study and more appendices added</p></details> |
| **[Causal Front-Door Adjustment for Robust Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05444v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities. Building on this observation, we model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective. Then, we propose the Causal Front-Door Adjustment Attack (CFA{$^2$}) to jailbreak LLM, which is a framework that leverages Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever the confounding associations for robust jailbreaking. Specifically, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to physically strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent. We further reduce computationally expensive marginalization to a deterministic intervention with low inference complexity. Experiments demonstrate that CFA{$^2$} achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeCircuit: Toward Inferring LLM-Generated Code Correctness via Attribution Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07080v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current paradigms for code verification rely heavily on external mechanisms-such as execution-based unit tests or auxiliary LLM judges-which are often labor-intensive or limited by the judging model's own capabilities. This raises a fundamental, yet unexplored question: Can an LLM's functional correctness be assessed purely from its internal computational structure? Our primary objective is to investigate whether the model's neural dynamics encode internally decodable signals that are predictive of logical validity during code generation. Inspired by mechanistic interpretability, we propose to treat code verification as a mechanistic diagnostic task, mapping the model's explicit algorithmic trajectory into line-level attribution graphs. By decomposing complex residual flows, we aim to identify the structural signatures that distinguish sound reasoning from logical failure within the model's internal circuits. Analysis across Python, C++, and Java confirms that intrinsic correctness signals are robust across diverse syntaxes. Topological features from these internal graphs predict correctness more reliably than surface heuristics and enable targeted causal interventions to fix erroneous logic. These findings establish internal introspection as a decodable property for verifying generated code. Our code is at https:// github.com/bruno686/CodeCircuit.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLM-Scope: Mechanistic Interpretability of Diffusion Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05859v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Split Personality Training: Revealing Latent Knowledge Through Alternate Personalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05532v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Opinion Dynamics Modeling with Neural Diffusion-Convection-Reaction Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05403v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.</p></details> |  |

We contribute a decision theoretic framework that treats explanations as information signals valued by the expected improvement they enable on a specified decision task. This approach yields three distinct estimands: 1) a theoretical benchmark that upperbounds achievable performance by any agent with the explanation, 2) a human-complementary value that quantifies the theoretically attainable value that is not already captured by a baseline human decision policy, and 3) a behavioral value representing the causal effect of providing the explanation to human decision-makers. We instantiate these definitions in a practical validation workflow, and apply them to assess explanation potential and interpret behavioral effects in human-AI decision support and mechanistic interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Attention Post-Training for Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05865v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a simple post-training method that makes transformer attention sparse without sacrificing performance. Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 7B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\approx 0.4 \%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. Additionally, using cross-layer transcoders, we show that sparse attention substantially simplifies attention attribution, enabling a unified view of feature-based and circuit-based perspectives. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models.</p></details> |  |
