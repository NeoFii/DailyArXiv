| **[MASPO: Unifying Gradient Utilization, Probability Mass, and Signal Reliability for Robust and Sample-Efficient LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17550v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

| **[When Models Ignore Definitions: Measuring Semantic Override Hallucinations in LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17520v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on standard digital logic and Boolean reasoning tasks, yet their reliability under locally redefined semantics remains poorly understood. In many formal settings, such as circuit specifications, examinations, and hardware documentation, operators and components are explicitly redefined within narrow scope. Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification. We introduce a compact micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks designed as verifier-style traps, spanning Boolean algebra, operator overloading, redefined gates, and circuit-level semantics. Evaluating three frontier LLMs, we observe persistent noncompliance with local specifications, confident but incompatible assumptions, and dropped constraints even in elementary settings. Our findings highlight a gap between surface-level correctness and specification-faithful reasoning, motivating evaluation protocols that explicitly test local unlearning and semantic compliance in formal domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Design of KL-Regularized Policy Gradient Algorithms for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17508v4)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. We extend our experiments to 8K context length, and RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip achieves 52% accuracy on AIME25, surpassing the official Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (47%). Notably, RPG is a stable and scalable RL algorithm for LLM reasoning, realized via (a) a KL-correct objective, (b) clipped importance sampling, and (c) an iterative reference-policy update scheme.

| **[SPARC: Scenario Planning and Reasoning for Automated C Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16671v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated unit test generation for C remains a formidable challenge due to the semantic gap between high-level program intent and the rigid syntactic constraints of pointer arithmetic and manual memory management. While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities, direct intent-to-code synthesis frequently suffers from the leap-to-code failure mode, where models prematurely emit code without grounding in program structure, constraints, and semantics. This will result in non-compilable tests, hallucinated function signatures, low branch coverage, and semantically irrelevant assertions that cannot properly capture bugs. We introduce SPARC, a neuro-symbolic, scenario-based framework that bridges this gap through four stages: (1) Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis, (2) an Operation Map that grounds LLM reasoning in validated utility helpers, (3) Path-targeted test synthesis, and (4) an iterative, self-correction validation loop using compiler and runtime feedback. We evaluate SPARC on 59 real-world and algorithmic subjects, where it outperforms the vanilla prompt generation baseline by 31.36% in line coverage, 26.01% in branch coverage, and 20.78% in mutation score, matching or exceeding the symbolic execution tool KLEE on complex subjects. SPARC retains 94.3% of tests through iterative repair and produces code with significantly higher developer-rated readability and maintainability. By aligning LLM reasoning with program structure, SPARC provides a scalable path for industrial-grade testing of legacy C codebases.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Static Pipelines: Learning Dynamic Workflows for Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15564v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-SQL has recently achieved impressive progress, yet remains difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. This gap stems from the reliance on single static workflows, fundamentally limiting scalability to out-of-distribution and long-tail scenarios. Instead of requiring users to select suitable methods through extensive experimentation, we attempt to enable systems to adaptively construct workflows at inference time. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that optimal dynamic policies consistently outperform the best static workflow, with performance gains fundamentally driven by heterogeneity across candidate workflows. Motivated by this, we propose SquRL, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning capability in adaptive workflow construction. We design a rule-based reward function and introduce two effective training mechanisms: dynamic actor masking to encourage broader exploration, and pseudo rewards to improve training efficiency. Experiments on widely-used Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate that dynamic workflow construction consistently outperforms the best static workflow methods, with especially pronounced gains on complex and out-of-distribution queries. The codes are available at https://github.com/Satissss/SquRL</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-as-Judge on a Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15481v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a cornerstone technique for evaluating large language models by leveraging LLM reasoning to score prompt-response pairs. Since LLM judgments are stochastic, practitioners commonly query each pair multiple times to estimate mean scores accurately. This raises a critical challenge: given a fixed computational budget $B$, how to optimally allocate queries across $K$ prompt-response pairs to minimize estimation error? % We present a principled variance-adaptive approach leveraging multi-armed bandit theory and concentration inequalities. Our method dynamically allocates queries based on estimated score variances, concentrating resources where uncertainty is highest. Further, our algorithm is shown to achieve a worst-case score-estimation error of $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^K σ_i^2}{B}}\right)$, $σ_i^2$ being the unknown score variance for pair $i \in [K]$ with near-optimal budget allocation. % Experiments on \emph{Summarize-From-Feedback} and \emph{HelpSteer2} demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms uniform allocation, reducing worst-case estimation error while maintaining identical budgets. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for efficient LLM evaluation with practical implications for AI safety, model alignment, and automated assessment at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-AI Interaction: Evaluating LLM Reasoning on Digital Logic Circuit included Graph Problems, in terms of creativity in design and analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15336v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by undergraduate students as on-demand tutors, yet their reliability on circuit- and diagram-based digital logic problems remains unclear. We present a human- AI study evaluating three widely used LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and Claude) on 10 undergraduate-level digital logic questions spanning non-standard counters, JK-based state transitions, timing diagrams, frequency division, and finite-state machines. Twenty-four students performed pairwise model comparisons, providing per-question judgments on (i) preferred model, (ii) perceived correctness, (iii) consistency, (iv) verbosity, and (v) confidence, along with global ratings of overall model quality, satisfaction across multiple dimensions (e.g., accuracy and clarity), and perceived mental effort required to verify answers. To benchmark technical validity, we applied an independent judge-based evaluation against official solutions for all ten questions, using strict correctness criteria. Results reveal a consistent gap between perceived helpfulness and formal correctness: for the most sequentially demanding problems (Q1- Q7), none of the evaluated LLMs matched the official answers, despite producing confident, well-structured explanations that students often rated favorably. Error analysis indicates that models frequently default to canonical textbook templates (e.g., standard ripple counters) and struggle to translate circuit structure into exact state evolution and timing behavior. These findings suggest that, without verification scaffolds, LLMs may be unreliable for core digital logic topics and can inadvertently reinforce misconceptions in undergraduate instruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedPlan: A Two-Stage RAG-Based System for Personalized Medical Plan Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17900v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent success in applying large language models (LLMs) to electronic health records (EHR), most systems focus primarily on assessment rather than treatment planning. We identify three critical limitations in current approaches: they generate treatment plans in a single pass rather than following the sequential reasoning process used by clinicians; they rarely incorporate patient-specific historical context; and they fail to effectively distinguish between subjective and objective clinical information. Motivated by the SOAP methodology (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), we introduce \ours{}, a novel framework that structures LLM reasoning to align with real-life clinician workflows. Our approach employs a two-stage architecture that first generates a clinical assessment based on patient symptoms and objective data, then formulates a structured treatment plan informed by this assessment and enriched with patient-specific information through retrieval-augmented generation. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in both assessment accuracy and treatment plan quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Diverse: Mitigating Diversity Illusion in Self-Play LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13103v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-play bootstraps LLM reasoning through an iterative Challenger-Solver loop: the Challenger is trained to generate questions that target the Solver's capabilities, and the Solver is optimized on the generated data to expand its reasoning skills. However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Gengsheng-Li/R-Diverse.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoTime: Memory-Augmented Temporal Knowledge Graph Enhanced Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13614v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities, but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However, existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time, enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse. Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2026 (WWW, 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Scalable LLM Reasoning Acceleration with Low-rank Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07861v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper, we propose Caprese, a resource-efficient distillation method to recover lost capabilities from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters, and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all of the reasoning capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>16% time-to-next-token reduction) while encouraging response brevity (up to 8.5% fewer tokens).</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Early Stopping for Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13935v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLMs have seen substantial improvement in reasoning capabilities, they also sometimes overthink, generating unnecessary reasoning steps, particularly under uncertainty, given ill-posed or ambiguous queries. We introduce statistically principled early stopping methods that monitor uncertainty signals during generation to mitigate this issue. Our first approach is parametric: it models inter-arrival times of uncertainty keywords as a renewal process and applies sequential testing for stopping. Our second approach is nonparametric and provides finite-sample guarantees on the probability of halting too early on well-posed queries. We conduct empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks across several domains and models. Our results indicate that uncertainty-aware early stopping can improve both efficiency and reliability in LLM reasoning, and we observe especially significant gains for math reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-State-Aware LLM Reasoning for Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13574v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) generation is a critical task in software security, serving as a cornerstone for vulnerability validation, false positive reduction, and patch verification. While directed fuzzing effectively drives path exploration, satisfying complex semantic constraints remains a persistent bottleneck in automated exploit generation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their semantic reasoning capabilities; however, existing LLM-based approaches lack sufficient grounding in concrete execution behavior, limiting their ability to generate precise PoVs. In this paper, we present DrillAgent, an agentic framework that reformulates PoV generation as an iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement process. To bridge the gap between static reasoning and dynamic execution, DrillAgent synergizes LLM-based semantic inference with feedback from concrete program states. The agent analyzes the target code to hypothesize inputs, observes execution behavior, and employs a novel mechanism to translate low-level execution traces into source-level constraints. This closed-loop design enables the agent to incrementally align its input generation with the precise requirements of the vulnerability. We evaluate DrillAgent on SEC-bench, a large-scale benchmark of real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that DrillAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM agent baselines under fixed budget constraints, solving up to 52.8% more CVE tasks than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the necessity of execution-state-aware reasoning for reliable PoV generation in complex software systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 1.0 (13 pages, 7 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Think Deep, Not Just Long: Measuring LLM Reasoning Effort via Deep-Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13517v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, recent findings suggest that raw token counts are unreliable proxies for reasoning quality: increased generation length does not consistently correlate with accuracy and may instead signal "overthinking," leading to performance degradation. In this work, we quantify inference-time effort by identifying deep-thinking tokens -- tokens where internal predictions undergo significant revisions in deeper model layers prior to convergence. Across four challenging mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, and GPQA-diamond) and a diverse set of reasoning-focused models (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3), we show that deep-thinking ratio (the proportion of deep-thinking tokens in a generated sequence) exhibits a robust and consistently positive correlation with accuracy, substantially outperforming both length-based and confidence-based baselines. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Think@n, a test-time scaling strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios. We demonstrate that Think@n matches or exceeds standard self-consistency performance while significantly reducing inference costs by enabling the early rejection of unpromising generations based on short prefixes.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Reproduction of Networking Research Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21074v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reproduction is a cornerstone of scientific validity, yet it remains a formidable challenge in computer networking research due to the scarcity of open-source implementations and the complexity of heterogeneous system architectures. While Large Language Models have demonstrated potential in code generation, existing code generation frameworks often fail to address the long-context constraints and intricate logical dependencies required to reproduce network systems from academic papers. To facilitate result reproduction, we introduce \emph{RepLLM}, an end-to-end multi-agent framework designed to automate the transformation of network research into executable code. RepLLM features a novel collaborative architecture comprising four specialized agents -- Content Parsing, Architecture Design, Code Generation, and Audit \& Repair -- coordinated through an explicit \textit{Shared Memory} mechanism to ensure global context consistency. With the enhancement of Chain-of-Thought LLM reasoning and a sandbox-isolated static-dynamic debugging methodology, our framework effectively resolves semantic discrepancies and runtime errors. Extensive evaluations on representative papers from SIGCOMM and NSDI demonstrate that RepLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating compile-ready and logically correct systems. Results further demonstrate that RepLLM facilitates the reproduction of 80\% of the original benchmarks with only four hours of human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Recent findings suggest that RLVR primarily functions by eliciting latent capabilities, motivating the development of verifier-free algorithms. However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers. By prioritizing high-confidence samples, VI-CuRL effectively manages the bias-variance trade-off, specifically targeting the reduction of action and problem variance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that our estimator guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness. Empirically, VI-CuRL promotes stability and consistently outperforms verifier-independent baselines across six challenging benchmarks with/without verifiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning to Rank: An End-to-End Solution for Exploiting Large Language Models for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12530v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are tasked to infer users' evolving preferences and rank items aligned with their intents, which calls for in-depth reasoning beyond pattern-based scoring. Recent efforts start to leverage large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, but how to effectively optimize the model for improved recommendation utility is still under explored. In this work, we propose Reasoning to Rank, an end-to-end training framework that internalizes recommendation utility optimization into the learning of step-by-step reasoning in LLMs. To avoid position bias in LLM reasoning and enable direct optimization of the reasoning process, our framework performs reasoning at the user-item level and employs reinforcement learning for end-to-end training of the LLM. Experiments on three Amazon datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset showed consistent gains over strong conventional and LLM-based solutions. Extensive in-depth analyses validate the necessity of the key components in the proposed framework and shed lights on the future developments of this line of work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLM Reasoning Beyond Correctness and CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18134v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Current evaluations reward models' correct standalone answers-but correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. We argue that reasoning should be understood not as a static chain of steps but as a dynamic trajectory in which ideas interact, clash, and evolve into integrated insights. Building on the philosophical tradition of dialectics, we introduce SIEV, a structured evaluation framework that assesses reasoning through explicit thesis-antithesis-synthesis interactions. SIEV produces interpretable trajectories that highlight key properties of reasoning-robustness to challenge, adaptability under conflict, and synthesis across competing viewpoints-dimensions that conventional correctness-based metrics cannot capture. Empirical results on GSM and MMLU demonstrate substantial gaps in the reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art models: for example, GPT-5-chat loses more than 40 points (out of 100) on GSM when evaluated through SIEV's process-oriented lens. By shifting focus from what answer a model gives to how it arrives there, SIEV enables a more transparent and principled distinction between structured reasoning and surface-level pattern generation offering a clearer foundation for assessing and understanding the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Demo Is All It Takes: Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs from A Single Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18382v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) show promise for robotic task planning but often struggle to guarantee correctness in long-horizon problems. Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by grounding symbolic plans in low-level execution, yet it relies heavily on manually engineered planning domains. To improve long-horizon planning reliability and reduce human intervention, we present Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs (PDDLLM), a framework that automatically induces symbolic predicates and actions directly from demonstration trajectories by combining LLM reasoning with physical simulation roll-outs. Unlike prior domain-inference methods that rely on partially predefined or language descriptions of planning domains, PDDLLM constructs domains without manual domain initialization and automatically integrates them with motion planners to produce executable plans, enhancing long-horizon planning automation. Across 1,200 tasks in nine environments, PDDLLM outperforms six LLM-based planning baselines, achieving at least 20\% higher success rates, reduced token costs, and successful deployment on multiple physical robot platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.</p></details> |  |

| **[Evaluating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Reusability and Verifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17544v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining and Evaluating Physical Safety for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02317v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to control robotic systems such as drones, but their risks of causing physical threats and harm in real-world applications remain unexplored. Our study addresses the critical gap in evaluating LLM physical safety by developing a comprehensive benchmark for drone control. We classify the physical safety risks of drones into four categories: (1) human-targeted threats, (2) object-targeted threats, (3) infrastructure attacks, and (4) regulatory violations. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals an undesirable trade-off between utility and safety, with models that excel in code generation often performing poorly in crucial safety aspects. Furthermore, while incorporating advanced prompt engineering techniques such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought can improve safety, these methods still struggle to identify unintentional attacks. In addition, larger models demonstrate better safety capabilities, particularly in refusing dangerous commands. Our findings and benchmark can facilitate the design and evaluation of physical safety for LLMs. The project page is available at huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/LLM-physical-safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy After $\langle \texttt{/Think} \rangle$ for reasoning model early exiting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26522v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning LLMs show improved performance with longer chains of thought. However, recent work has highlighted their tendency to overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency from the distribution dynamics perspective by tracking Pass@1 for answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find the model often begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making extra reasoning tokens wasteful. To detect and prevent overthinking, we propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal, Entropy After </Think> (EAT), for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token usage by 12 - 22% without harming accuracy. EAT also remains effective in black box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT is computed with proxy models: We verified the feasibility via early stopping Llama 70B with a 1.5B model and Claude 3.7 with a local 4B model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data assets are available at https://github.com/xidulu/EAT</p></details> |
| **[Understanding LLM Failures: A Multi-Tape Turing Machine Analysis of Systematic Errors in Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15868v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit failure modes on seemingly trivial tasks. We propose a formalisation of LLM interaction using a deterministic multi-tape Turing machine, where each tape represents a distinct component: input characters, tokens, vocabulary, model parameters, activations, probability distributions, and output text. The model enables precise localisation of failure modes to specific pipeline stages, revealing, e.g., how tokenisation obscures character-level structure needed for counting tasks. The model clarifies why techniques like chain-of-thought prompting help, by externalising computation on the output tape, while also revealing their fundamental limitations. This approach provides a rigorous, falsifiable alternative to geometric metaphors and complements empirical scaling laws with principled error analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 page appendix; v2 added Acknowledgements</p></details> |
| **[NTLRAG: Narrative Topic Labels derived with Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17216v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topic modeling has evolved as an important means to identify evident or hidden topics within large collections of text documents. Topic modeling approaches are often used for analyzing and making sense of social media discussions consisting of millions of short text messages. However, assigning meaningful topic labels to document clusters remains challenging, as users are commonly presented with unstructured keyword lists that may not accurately capture the respective core topic. In this paper, we introduce Narrative Topic Labels derived with Retrieval Augmented Generation (NTLRAG), a scalable and extensible framework that generates semantically precise and human-interpretable narrative topic labels. Our narrative topic labels provide a context-rich, intuitive concept to describe topic model output. In particular, NTLRAG uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques and considers multiple retrieval strategies as well as chain-of-thought elements to provide high-quality output. NTLRAG can be combined with any standard topic model to generate, validate, and refine narratives which then serve as narrative topic labels. We evaluated NTLRAG with a user study and three real-world datasets consisting of more than 6.7 million social media messages that have been sent by more than 2.7 million users. The user study involved 16 human evaluators who found that our narrative topic labels offer superior interpretability and usability as compared to traditional keyword lists. An implementation of NTLRAG is publicly available for download.</p></details> |  |

By integrating domain-specific prompt engineering including In-Context Learning (ICL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and a multi-round feedback-verification flow, SimulatorCoder systematically transforms high-level functional requirements into efficient, executable, and architecture-aligned simulator code. Experiments based on the customized SCALE-Sim benchmark demonstrate that structured prompting and feedback mechanisms substantially improve both code generation accuracy and simulator performance. The resulting simulators not only maintain cycle-level fidelity with less than 1% error compared to manually implemented counterparts, but also consistently achieve lower simulation runtimes, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based methods in accelerating simulator development.

| **[TimeOmni-VL: Unified Models for Time Series Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17149v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent time series modeling faces a sharp divide between numerical generation and semantic understanding, with research showing that generation models often rely on superficial pattern matching, while understanding-oriented models struggle with high-fidelity numerical output. Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation. Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[AudioChat: Unified Audio Storytelling, Editing, and Understanding with Transfusion Forcing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17097v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent breakthroughs, audio foundation models struggle in processing complex multi-source acoustic scenes. We refer to this challenging domain as audio stories, which can have multiple speakers and background/foreground sound effects. Compared to traditional audio processing tasks, audio stories introduce new layers of semantic, temporal, and physical complexity. To address this challenge, we propose AudioChat, a framework for developing audio foundation models that can generate, edit, and understand audio stories. AudioChat introduces a new paradigm in which LLM-based toolcalling agents simulate interactions between users and the system, and these simulated dialogues are used as training data. We also introduce a novel Audio Transfusion Forcing objective to train the AudioChat model, allowing it to simultaneously decompose high-level instructions via structured chain-of-thought reasoning and perform interactive multi-turn audio understanding/generation. To evaluate generation and editing performance, we develop three new metrics that directly measure task performance instead of relying upon distribution-based scoring. We highly encourage readers to visit our demo to better understand the capabilities of AudioChat: https://wanchichen.github.io/audiochat/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Biases in the Blind Spot: Detecting What LLMs Fail to Mention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10117v3)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces that appear plausible, but may hide internal biases. We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across seven LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Second, we develop the framework of litmus tests, evaluations that quantify an LLM's choice behavior on a stylized decision-making task with multiple conflicting objectives. Each litmus test outputs a litmus score, which quantifies an LLM's tradeoff response, a reliability score, which measures the coherence of an LLM's choice behavior, and a competency score, which measures an LLM's capability at the same task when the conflicting objectives are replaced by a single, well-specified objective. Evaluating a broad array of frontier LLMs, we (1) investigate changes in LLM capabilities and tendencies over time, (2) derive economically meaningful insights from the LLMs' choice behavior and chain-of-thought, (3) validate our litmus test framework by testing self-consistency, robustness, and generalizability. Overall, this work provides a foundation for evaluating LLM agents as they are further integrated into economic decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3 wa...</summary><p>v3 was a major revision with updated experiments and analysis; v4 consists of minor edits</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval Augmented Generation Enhances Rare Disease Diagnosis from Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12286v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Thinking Hurts? Diagnosing and Rectifying the Reasoning Shift in Foundation Recommender Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16587v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into Semantic ID-based recommendation foundation models (such as OpenOneRec) often paradoxically degrades recommendation performance. We identify the root cause as textual inertia from the General Subspace, where verbose reasoning dominates inference and causes the model to neglect critical Semantic ID. To address this, we propose a training-free Inference-Time Subspace Alignment framework. By compressing reasoning chains and applying bias-subtracted contrastive decoding, our approach mitigates ungrounded textual drift. Experiments show this effectively calibrates inference, allowing foundation models to leverage reasoning without sacrificing ID-grounded accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Framework of Thoughts: A Foundation Framework for Dynamic and Optimized Reasoning based on Chains, Trees, and Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16512v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[SurgRAW: Multi-Agent Workflow with Chain of Thought Reasoning for Robotic Surgical Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10265v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) is central to modern surgery, driving the need for intelligent systems with accurate scene understanding. Most existing surgical AI methods rely on isolated, task-specific models, leading to fragmented pipelines with limited interpretability and no unified understanding of RAS scene. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer strong zero-shot reasoning, but struggle with hallucinations, domain gaps and weak task-interdependency modeling. To address the lack of unified data for RAS scene understanding, we introduce SurgCoTBench, the first reasoning-focused benchmark in RAS, covering 14256 QA pairs with frame-level annotations across five major surgical tasks. Building on SurgCoTBench, we propose SurgRAW, a clinically aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) driven agentic workflow for zero-shot multi-task reasoning in surgery. SurgRAW employs a hierarchical reasoning workflow where an orchestrator divides surgical scene understanding into two reasoning streams and directs specialized agents to generate task-level reasoning, while higher-level agents capture workflow interdependencies or ground output clinically. Specifically, we propose a panel discussion mechanism to ensure task-specific agents collaborate synergistically and leverage on task interdependencies. Similarly, we incorporate a retrieval-augmented generation module to enrich agents with surgical knowledge and alleviate domain gaps in general VLMs. We design task-specific CoT prompts grounded in surgical domain to ensure clinically aligned reasoning, reduce hallucinations and enhance interpretability. Extensive experiments show that SurgRAW surpasses mainstream VLMs and agentic systems and outperforms a supervised model by 14.61% accuracy. Dataset and code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/SurgRAW.git .</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces IndicEval, a scalable benchmarking platform designed to assess LLM performance using authentic high-stakes examination questions from UPSC, JEE, and NEET across STEM and humanities domains in both English and Hindi. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, IndicEval grounds evaluation in real examination standards, enabling realistic measurement of reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability. The framework automates assessment using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies and supports modular integration of new models and languages. Experiments conducted on Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA 3-70B reveal three major findings. First, CoT prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy, with substantial gains across subjects and languages. Second, significant cross-model performance disparities persist, particularly in high-complexity examinations. Third, multilingual degradation remains a critical challenge, with marked accuracy drops in Hindi compared to English, especially under Zero-Shot conditions. These results highlight persistent gaps in bilingual reasoning and domain transfer. Overall, IndicEval provides a practice-oriented, extensible foundation for rigorous, equitable evaluation of LLMs in multilingual educational settings and offers actionable insights for improving reasoning robustness and language adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoeTone: A Framework for Constrained Generation of Structured Chinese Songci with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02515v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation, and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15 open-source models across 4 families, under five prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-based, and chain-of-thought. Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as a scoring function for best-of-N selection, we fine-tune 3 lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally constrained literary texts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain of Thought in Order: Discovering Learning-Friendly Orders for Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23875v3)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The chain of thought, i.e., step-by-step reasoning, is one of the fundamental mechanisms of Transformers. While the design of intermediate reasoning steps has been extensively studied and shown to critically influence performance on mathematical, multi-step reasoning tasks, the ordering of these steps has received little attention, despite its significant effect on the difficulty of reasoning. This study addresses a novel task of unraveling the chain of thought -- reordering decoder input tokens into a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers, for learning arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space grows factorially in sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on seven order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior studies for the multiplication task.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures |

Here we present SkinGPT-R1, a multimodal large language model that integrates chain-of-thought diagnostic reasoning with a fairness-aware mixture-of-experts architecture for interpretable and equitable skin disease diagnosis. Through parameter-efficient adaptation of a frozen reasoning backbone, SkinGPT-R1 generates structured diagnostic reports comprising visual findings, differential reasoning, and final diagnosis. Across seven external datasets spanning diverse pathologies and imaging conditions, SkinGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on six benchmarks, including 82.50\% on a challenging 40-class long-tail classification task (+19.30\% over leading baselines). Blinded evaluation by five board-certified dermatologists on 1,000 phenotypically balanced cases yields a mean score of 3.6 out of 5, with the highest ratings in safety (3.8) and reasoning coherence (3.6), indicating that the generated rationales are clinically safe, logically grounded, and suitable for supporting diagnostic decision-making. Critically, SkinGPT-R1 mitigates algorithmic bias across the full Fitzpatrick spectrum, achieving a robust worst-group performance of 41.40\% on the Fitz17k benchmark and a five-fold relative improvement in lower-bound accuracy on the DDI dataset compared to standard multimodal baselines. These results establish a framework for trustworthy, fair, and explainable AI-assisted dermatological diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Faithfulness and Performance in Reasoning via Multi-Listener Soft Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16154v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning sometimes fails to faithfully reflect the true computation of a large language model (LLM), hampering its utility in explaining how LLMs arrive at their answers. Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who "execute" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/nsivaku/remul</p></details> |

However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/MedVLThinker/ ; Code: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/MedVLThinker ; Model and Data: https://huggingface.co/collections/UCSC-VLAA/medvlthinker-688f52224fb7ff7d965d581d ; Accepted by ML4H'25</p></details> |

| **[Stroke Lesions as a Rosetta Stone for Language Model Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04074v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet methods to verify which model components are truly necessary for language function remain limited. Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.</p></details> | 45 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Gradient Signal-to-Noise Data Selection for Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13697v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction tuning is a standard paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs), but modern instruction datasets are large, noisy, and redundant, making full-data fine-tuning costly and often unnecessary. Existing data selection methods either build expensive gradient datastores or assign static scores from a weak proxy, largely ignoring evolving uncertainty, and thus missing a key source of LLM interpretability. We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Shared Geometry of Difficulty in Multilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12731v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting problem-difficulty in large language models (LLMs) refers to estimating how difficult a task is according to the model itself, typically by training linear probes on its internal representations. In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-SAM-LLM: Large Language Models as Causal Reasoners for Robust Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03585v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains. This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Self-reflection in Automated Qualitative Coding: Improving Text Annotation through Secondary LLM Critique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09905v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) allow for sophisticated qualitative coding of large datasets, but zero- and few-shot classifiers can produce an intolerable number of errors, even with careful, validated prompting. We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Word Synchronization Challenge: A Benchmark for Word Association Responses for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08312v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the Word Synchronization Challenge, a novel benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This benchmark uses a dynamic game-like framework to test LLMs ability to mimic human cognitive processes through word associations. By simulating complex human interactions, it assesses how LLMs interpret and align with human thought patterns during conversational exchanges, which are essential for effective social partnerships in HCI. Initial findings highlight the influence of model sophistication on performance, offering insights into the models capabilities to engage in meaningful social interactions and adapt behaviors in human-like ways. This research advances the understanding of LLMs potential to replicate or diverge from human cognitive functions, paving the way for more nuanced and empathetic human-machine collaborations.</p></details> |  |

Yet the extent to which these models align with human judgments in interpreting figurative and socially grounded language remains uncertain. To investigate this, human participants and four instruction-tuned LLMs of different sizes (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, and Mistral-7B) rated 240 dialogue-based sentences representing six linguistic traits: conventionality, sarcasm, funny, emotional, idiomacy, and slang. Each of the 240 sentences was paired with 40 interpretive questions, and both humans and LLMs rated these sentences on a 10-point Likert scale. Results indicated that humans and LLMs aligned at the surface level with humans, but diverged significantly at the representational level, especially in interpreting figurative sentences involving idioms and Gen Z slang. GPT-4 most closely approximates human representational patterns, while all models struggle with context-dependent and socio-pragmatic expressions like sarcasm, slang, and idiomacy.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce a Neuro-Symbolic Compliance Framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to enable formal verifiability and optimization-based compliance correction. The LLM interprets statutes and enforcement cases to generate SMT constraints, while the solver enforces consistency and computes the minimal factual modification required to restore legality when penalties arise. Unlike transparency-oriented methods, our approach emphasizes logic-driven optimization, delivering verifiable, legally consistent reasoning rather than post-hoc explanation. Evaluated on 87 enforcement cases from Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), the system attains 86.2% correctness in SMT code generation, improves reasoning efficiency by over 100x, and consistently corrects violations-establishing a preliminary foundation for optimization-based compliance applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 tables, 3 figures, accepted by the 2nd ACM AIware Conference</p></details> |
| **[LLM Interpretability with Identifiable Temporal-Instantaneous Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23323v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling, instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Control with Large Language Models for Language-Guided Spatial Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17321v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have recently become effective tools for language-conditioned control in embodied systems, instability, slow convergence, and hallucinated actions continue to limit their direct application to continuous control. A modular neuro-symbolic control framework that clearly distinguishes between low-level motion execution and high-level semantic reasoning is proposed in this work. While a lightweight neural delta controller performs bounded, incremental actions in continuous space, a locally deployed LLM interprets symbolic tasks. We assess the suggested method in a planar manipulation setting with spatial relations between objects specified by language. Numerous tasks and local language models, such as Mistral, Phi, and LLaMA-3.2, are used in extensive experiments to compare LLM-only control, neural-only control, and the suggested LLM+DL framework. In comparison to LLM-only baselines, the results show that the neuro-symbolic integration consistently increases both success rate and efficiency, achieving average step reductions exceeding 70% and speedups of up to 8.83x while remaining robust to language model quality. The suggested framework enhances interpretability, stability, and generalization without any need of reinforcement learning or costly rollouts by controlling the LLM to symbolic outputs and allocating uninterpreted execution to a neural controller trained on artificial geometric data. These outputs show empirically that neuro-symbolic decomposition offers a scalable and principled way to integrate language understanding with ongoing control, this approach promotes the creation of dependable and effective language-guided embodied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trust Me, I Know This Function: Hijacking LLM Static Analysis using Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17361v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA). We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective against basic and reasoning models, but are also transferable across model families (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), and universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of code-oriented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verification-Guided Context Optimization for Tool Calling via Hierarchical LLMs-as-Editors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13860v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external environments through tool invocation, providing a practical way to overcome the limitations of pretraining. However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Workshop on Agentic AI Benchmarks and Applications for Enterprise Tasks</p></details> |
| **[Visualizing token importance for black-box language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11573v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of auditing black-box large language models (LLMs) to ensure they behave reliably when deployed in production settings, particularly in high-stakes domains such as legal, medical, and regulatory compliance. Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cache What Lasts: Token Retention for Memory-Bounded KV Cache in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03324v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory and computation remain core bottlenecks in long-horizon LLM inference due to the quadratic cost of self-attention and the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training. Our code and data will be open source to encourage future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 main.

A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness. Compared with prior LLM-based systems, CoMuRoS uniquely demonstrates runtime, event-driven replanning on physical robots, delivering robust, flexible multi-robot and human-robot collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

This project proposes an interdisciplinary study of linguistic errors produced by native Spanish speakers, with the aim of analyzing how current large language models (LLM) interpret, reproduce, or correct them. The research integrates three core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand the nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within real-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing (NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A purpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as the foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI models such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their ability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior. The project contributes not only to the understanding of Spanish as a native language but also to the development of NLP systems that are more cognitively informed and capable of engaging with the imperfect, variable, and often ambiguous nature of real human language.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Carotid ultrasound, a non-invasive and widely accessible modality, encodes rich structural and hemodynamic information that is largely untapped. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that extracts clinically meaningful representations of vascular damage (VD) from carotid ultrasound videos, using hypertension as a weak proxy label. The model learns robust features that are biologically plausible, interpretable, and strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. High VD stratifies individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models such as SCORE2. Explainable AI analyses reveal that the model relies on vessel morphology and perivascular tissue characteristics, uncovering novel functional and anatomical signatures of vascular damage. This work demonstrates that routine carotid ultrasound contains far more prognostic information than previously recognized. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tool for population-wide cardiovascular risk assessment, enabling earlier and more personalized prevention strategies without reliance on laboratory tests or complex clinical inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Linear Surrogates: High-Fidelity Local Explanations for Black-Box Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05556v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing complexity of black-box machine learning models and their adoption in high-stakes areas, it is critical to provide explanations for their predictions. Existing local explanation methods lack in generating high-fidelity explanations. This paper proposes a novel local model agnostic explanation method to generate high-fidelity explanations using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and N-ball sampling strategies. MARS is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity. The N-ball sampling technique samples perturbed samples directly from a desired distribution instead of reweighting, leading to further improvement in the faithfulness. The performance of the proposed method was computed in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and evaluated on five different benchmark datasets with different kernel width. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher local surrogate fidelity compared to baseline local explanation methods, with an average reduction of 32% in root mean square error, indicating more accurate local approximations of the black-box model. Additionally, statistical analysis shows that across all benchmark datasets, the proposed approach results were statistically significantly better. This paper advances the field of explainable AI by providing insights that can benefit the broader research and practitioner community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Message Passing: A Symbolic Alternative for Expressive and Interpretable Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16947v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery, yet their black-box nature remains a significant barrier to trustworthiness. While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 pages |
| **[Explainable AI: Context-Aware Layer-Wise Integrated Gradients for Explaining Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16608v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains and tasks, yet their deeply layered representations make their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models.</p></details> |  |

This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models. Previous studies demonstrating successful XAI application should be reevaluated with respect to a possibly spurious concurrency of feature salience and informativeness, and workflows using feature attribution methods as building blocks should be scrutinised.</p></details> |  |

Here we present SkinGPT-R1, a multimodal large language model that integrates chain-of-thought diagnostic reasoning with a fairness-aware mixture-of-experts architecture for interpretable and equitable skin disease diagnosis. Through parameter-efficient adaptation of a frozen reasoning backbone, SkinGPT-R1 generates structured diagnostic reports comprising visual findings, differential reasoning, and final diagnosis. Across seven external datasets spanning diverse pathologies and imaging conditions, SkinGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on six benchmarks, including 82.50\% on a challenging 40-class long-tail classification task (+19.30\% over leading baselines). Blinded evaluation by five board-certified dermatologists on 1,000 phenotypically balanced cases yields a mean score of 3.6 out of 5, with the highest ratings in safety (3.8) and reasoning coherence (3.6), indicating that the generated rationales are clinically safe, logically grounded, and suitable for supporting diagnostic decision-making. Critically, SkinGPT-R1 mitigates algorithmic bias across the full Fitzpatrick spectrum, achieving a robust worst-group performance of 41.40\% on the Fitz17k benchmark and a five-fold relative improvement in lower-bound accuracy on the DDI dataset compared to standard multimodal baselines. These results establish a framework for trustworthy, fair, and explainable AI-assisted dermatological diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, computing Shapley values exactly requires $2^d$ game evaluations for a model with $d$ features. Lundberg and Lee's KernelSHAP algorithm has emerged as a leading method for avoiding this exponential cost. KernelSHAP approximates Shapley values by approximating the game as a linear function, which is fit using a small number of game evaluations for random feature subsets. In this work, we extend KernelSHAP by approximating the game via higher degree polynomials, which capture non-linear interactions between features. Our resulting PolySHAP method yields empirically better Shapley value estimates for various benchmark datasets, and we prove that these estimates are consistent. Moreover, we connect our approach to paired sampling (antithetic sampling), a ubiquitous modification to KernelSHAP that improves empirical accuracy. We prove that paired sampling outputs exactly the same Shapley value approximations as second-order PolySHAP, without ever fitting a degree 2 polynomial. To the best of our knowledge, this finding provides the first strong theoretical justification for the excellent practical performance of the paired sampling heuristic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2026: https://openreview.net/forum?id=M19J8UGguq</p></details> |
| **[ShapBPT: Image Feature Attributions Using Data-Aware Binary Partition Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07047v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel-level feature attributions are an important tool in eXplainable AI for Computer Vision (XCV), providing visual insights into how image features influence model predictions. The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans.</p></details> | AAAI-2026 |
| **[A unified framework for evaluating the robustness of machine-learning interpretability for prospect risking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14430v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In geophysics, hydrocarbon prospect risking involves assessing the risks associated with hydrocarbon exploration by integrating data from various sources. Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of "importance" and "relevance" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data. This robustness test gives us deeper insights into the models capabilities to handle erronous data and which XAI module works best in pair with which model for our dataset for hydorcarbon indication.</p></details> |  |

The system integrates three cognitively aligned roles: Rule Abstraction, Evidence Scoring, and Expert-Style Justification. These roles operate in a conversational workflow that enables non-experts to express analytical intent in natural language, inspect structured risk evidence, and obtain traceable, context-aware reasoning. Implemented with an open-source, web-based interface, HCLA translates user intent into explicit analytical rules, applies classical anomaly detectors to quantify evidential risk, and reconstructs expert-style justifications grounded in observable transactional signals. Experiments on a cryptocurrency anomaly dataset show that, while the underlying detector achieves strong predictive accuracy, HCLA substantially improves interpretability, interaction, and decision transparency. Importantly, HCLA is not designed to explain a black-box model in the conventional XAI sense. Instead, we reconstruct a traceable expert reasoning process that aligns algorithmic evidence with regulatory and investigative judgment. By explicitly separating evidence scoring from expert-style justification, the framework emphasizes accountability beyond explainability and addresses practical requirements for regulatory, audit, and compliance-driven financial forensics. We describe the system architecture, closed-loop interaction design, datasets, evaluation protocol, and limitations. We argue that a human-in-the-loop reasoning reconstruction paradigm is essential for achieving transparency, accountability, and trust in high-stakes financial environments.

| **[Designing a Rashomon Machine: Pluri-perspectivism and XAI for Creativity Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14232v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While intelligent technologies offer unique opportunities for creativity support, there are fundamental challenges in designing human-centered co-creative systems. Explainable AI (XAI) can contribute when shifting its traditional role from justification (explaining decisions) to exploration (explaining possibilities). Contextual understanding is essential for supporting embodied creativity. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are fundamentally limited, however, by their reliance on disembodied data. We propose Pluri-perspectivism as a framework for XAI, to bridge the epistemological gap between human and machine, and promote creative exploration. It is a pragmatic, action-oriented solution to guide the system, repurposing XAI methods such as the Rashomon Technique. This facilitates exploring a spectrum of creative possibilities, and the exchange of 'perspectives' between human and machine. Using Pluri-perspectivism as a framework for XAI, we can reintroduce productive friction and support human agency in human-machine creative collaborations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable XAI: Relating Understanding Across Domains with Explanation Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13675v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on explaining a single application, but when encountering related applications, users may rely on their prior understanding from previous explanations. This leads to either overgeneralization and AI overreliance, or burdensome independent memorization. Indeed, related decision tasks can share explanatory factors, but with some notable differences; e.g., body mass index (BMI) affects the risks for heart disease and diabetes at the same rate, but chest pain is more indicative of heart disease. Similarly, models using different attributes for the same task still share signals; e.g., temperature and pressure affect air pollution but in opposite directions due to the ideal gas law. Leveraging transfer of learning, we propose Transferable XAI to enable users to transfer understanding across related domains by explaining the relationship between domain explanations using a general affine transformation framework applied to linear factor explanations. The framework supports explanation transfer across various domain types: translation for data subspace (subsuming prior work on Incremental XAI), scaling for decision task, and mapping for attributes. Focusing on task and attributes domain types, in formative and summative user studies, we investigated how well participants could understand AI decisions from one domain to another. Compared to single-domain and domain-independent explanations, Transferable XAI was the most helpful for understanding the second domain, leading to the best decision faithfulness, factor recall, and ability to relate explanations between domains. This framework contributes to improving the reusability of explanations across related AI applications by explaining factor relationships between subspaces, tasks, and attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, accepted by IUI2026</p></details> |

In this Perspective, we argue that explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), combined with causal reasoning, enables {\it learning from the learners}. Focusing on discovery, optimization and certification, we show how the combination of foundation models and explainability methods allows the extraction of causal mechanisms, guides robust design and control, and supports trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.</p></details> |  |

This dependency puts them at risk of fraud and exploitation. To address these challenges, we first build a new Bangladeshi banknote dataset that includes both controlled and real-world scenarios, ensuring a more comprehensive and diverse representation. Next, to enhance the dataset's robustness, we incorporate four additional datasets, including public benchmarks, to cover various complexities and improve the model's generalization. To overcome the limitations of current recognition models, we propose a novel hybrid CNN architecture that combines MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNetB0 for efficient feature extraction. This is followed by an effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to improve performance while keeping computational costs low, making the system suitable for resource-constrained devices. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 97.95% accuracy on controlled datasets, 92.84% on complex backgrounds, and 94.98% accuracy when combining all datasets. The model's performance is thoroughly evaluated using five-fold cross-validation and seven metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa, MCC, and AUC. Additionally, explainable AI methods like LIME and SHAP are incorporated to enhance transparency and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PAKDD 2026</p></details> |
| **[X-SYS: A Reference Architecture for Interactive Explanation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12748v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explainable AI (XAI) research community has proposed numerous technical methods, yet deploying explainability as systems remains challenging: Interactive explanation systems require both suitable algorithms and system capabilities that maintain explanation usability across repeated queries, evolving models and data, and governance constraints. We argue that operationalizing XAI requires treating explainability as an information systems problem where user interaction demands induce specific system requirements. We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability. Together, this work provides a reusable blueprint and concrete instantiation for interactive explanation systems supporting end-to-end design under operational constraints.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Predicting Open Source Software Sustainability with Deep Temporal Neural Hierarchical Architectures and Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09064v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Source Software (OSS) projects follow diverse lifecycle trajectories shaped by evolving patterns of contribution, coordination, and community engagement. Understanding these trajectories is essential for stakeholders seeking to assess project organization and health at scale. However, prior work has largely relied on static or aggregated metrics, such as project age or cumulative activity, providing limited insight into how OSS sustainability unfolds over time. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical predictive framework that models OSS projects as belonging to distinct lifecycle stages grounded in established socio-technical categorizations of OSS development. Rather than treating sustainability solely as project longevity, these lifecycle stages operationalize sustainability as a multidimensional construct integrating contribution activity, community participation, and maintenance dynamics. The framework combines engineered tabular indicators with 24-month temporal activity sequences and employs a multi-stage classification pipeline to distinguish lifecycle stages associated with different coordination and participation regimes. To support transparency, we incorporate explainable AI techniques to examine the relative contribution of feature categories to model predictions. Evaluated on a large corpus of OSS repositories, the proposed approach achieves over 94\% overall accuracy in lifecycle stage classification. Attribution analyses consistently identify contribution activity and community-related features as dominant signals, highlighting the central role of collective participation dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This inconsistency hinders understanding, and because explanations are often read-only, users lack the control to improve alignment. We propose making XAI editable, allowing users to write rules to improve control and gain deeper understanding through the generation effect of active learning. We developed CoExplain, leveraging a neural network for universal representation and symbolic rules for intuitive reasoning on interpretable attributes. CoExplain explains the neural network with a faithful proxy decision tree, parses user-written rules as an equivalent neural network graph, and collaboratively optimizes the decision tree. In a user study (N=43), CoExplain and manually editable XAI improved user understanding and model alignment compared to read-only XAI. CoExplain was easier to use with fewer edits and less time. This work contributes Editable XAI for bidirectional AI alignment, improving understanding and control.</p></details> |  |

While XAI methods reveal computational processes for model validation and audit, end users require explanations integrating domain knowledge, contextual reasoning, and professional frameworks. This disconnect reveals a fundamental design challenge: existing AI explanation approaches fail to address how practitioners actually need to understand and act upon recommendations. This paper introduces Explanatory AI as a complementary paradigm where AI systems leverage generative and multimodal capabilities to serve as explanatory partners for human understanding. Unlike traditional XAI that answers "How did the algorithm decide?" for validation purposes, Explanatory AI addresses "Why does this make sense?" for practitioners making informed decisions. Through theory-informed design, we synthesize multidisciplinary perspectives on explanation from cognitive science, communication research, and education with empirical evidence from healthcare contexts and AI expert interviews. Our analysis identifies five dimensions distinguishing Explanatory AI from traditional XAI: explanatory purpose (from diagnostic to interpretive sense-making), communication mode (from static technical to dynamic narrative interaction), epistemic stance (from algorithmic correspondence to contextual plausibility), adaptivity (from uniform design to personalized accessibility), and cognitive design (from information overload to cognitively aligned delivery). We derive five meta-requirements specifying what systems must achieve and formulate ten design principles prescribing how to build them.</p></details> |  |

So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,9 figures, 2025 IEEE International Women in Engineering (WIE) Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (WIECON-ECE)</p></details> |

Applying this framework to scGPT and Geneformer, we find that attention patterns encode structured biological information with layer-specific organisation - protein-protein interactions in early layers, transcriptional regulation in late layers - but this structure provides no incremental value for perturbation prediction: trivial gene-level baselines outperform both attention and correlation edges (AUROC 0.81-0.88 versus 0.70), pairwise edge scores add zero predictive contribution, and causal ablation of regulatory heads produces no degradation. These findings generalise from K562 to RPE1 cells; the attention-correlation relationship is context-dependent, but gene-level dominance is universal. Cell-State Stratified Interpretability (CSSI) addresses an attention-specific scaling failure, improving GRN recovery up to 1.85x. The framework establishes reusable quality-control standards for the field.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the internal neural representations of cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical lens. By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text. Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods. Our results offer a new perspective on PII leakage: the superposition of a latent signal in the model's representations, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[On the Mechanism and Dynamics of Modular Addition: Fourier Features, Lottery Ticket, and Grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16849v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of how two-layer neural networks learn features to solve the modular addition task. Our work provides a full mechanistic interpretation of the learned model and a theoretical explanation of its training dynamics. While prior work has identified that individual neurons learn single-frequency Fourier features and phase alignment, it does not fully explain how these features combine into a global solution. We bridge this gap by formalizing a diversification condition that emerges during training when overparametrized, consisting of two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. We prove that these properties allow the network to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function on the correct logic for the modular addition task. While individual neurons produce noisy signals, the phase symmetry enables a majority-voting scheme that cancels out noise, allowing the network to robustly identify the correct sum. Furthermore, we explain the emergence of these features under random initialization via a lottery ticket mechanism. Our gradient flow analysis proves that frequencies compete within each neuron, with the "winner" determined by its initial spectral magnitude and phase alignment. From a technical standpoint, we provide a rigorous characterization of the layer-wise phase coupling dynamics and formalize the competitive landscape using the ODE comparison lemma. Finally, we use these insights to demystify grokking, characterizing it as a three-stage process involving memorization followed by two generalization phases, driven by the competition between loss minimization and weight decay.</p></details> |  |

While prior methods have made significant progress, they typically depend on heuristics or approximations and do not offer provable guarantees over continuous input domains for the resulting circuits. In this work, we leverage recent advances in neural network verification to propose a suite of automated algorithms that yield circuits with *provable guarantees*. We focus on three types of guarantees: (1) *input domain robustness*, ensuring the circuit agrees with the model across a continuous input region; (2) *robust patching*, certifying circuit alignment under continuous patching perturbations; and (3) *minimality*, formalizing and capturing a wide array of various notions of succinctness. Interestingly, we uncover a diverse set of novel theoretical connections among these three families of guarantees, with critical implications for the convergence of our algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments with state-of-the-art verifiers on various vision models, showing that our algorithms yield circuits with substantially stronger robustness guarantees than standard circuit discovery methods, establishing a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Yet, these network circuits are rarely acid-tested for their stability across different instances of the same deep learning architecture. Without this, it remains unclear whether reported circuits emerge universally across labs or turn out to be idiosyncratic to a particular estimation instance, potentially limiting confidence in safety-critical settings. Here, we systematically study stability across-refits in increasingly complex transformer language models of various sizes. We quantify, layer by layer, how similarly attention heads learn representations across independently initialized training runs. Our rigorous experiments show that (1) middle-layer heads are the least stable yet the most representationally distinct; (2) deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important than their peers from the same layer; (4) applying weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability across random model initializations; and (5) the residual stream is comparatively stable. Our findings establish the cross-instance robustness of circuits as an essential yet underappreciated prerequisite for scalable oversight, drawing contours around possible white-box monitorability of AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Body: 8 pages, Total length: 33 pages, Code repo: https://github.com/karanbali/attention_head_seed_stability , Weights repo: https://huggingface.co/karanbali/attention_head_seed_stability</p></details> |

Despite their strong empirical performance as feature extractors, the internal mechanisms underlying the robust generalization of SSL audio models remain unclear. Drawing on the framework of mechanistic interpretability, we identify and examine class-specific neurons by analyzing conditional activation patterns across diverse tasks. Our analysis reveals that SSL models foster the emergence of class-specific neurons that provide extensive coverage across novel task classes. These neurons exhibit shared responses across different semantic categories and acoustic similarities, such as speech attributes and musical pitch. We also confirm that these neurons have a functional impact on classification performance. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic neuron-level analysis of a general-purpose audio SSL model, providing new insights into its internal representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 8 figures.

To investigate this effect, we build a controlled synthetic retrieval task and find that a transformer trained only on text achieves perfect in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize out of distribution, while subsequent training on an image-tokenized version of the same task nearly doubles text-only OOD performance. Mechanistic interpretability reveals that visual training changes the model's internal binding strategy: text-only training encourages positional shortcuts, whereas image-based training disrupts them through spatial translation invariance, forcing the model to adopt a more robust symbolic binding mechanism that persists even after text-only examples are reintroduced. We further characterize how binding strategies vary across training regimes, visual encoders, and initializations, and show that analogous shifts occur during pretrained LLM-to-VLM transitions. Our findings suggest that cross-modal training can enhance reasoning and generalization even for tasks grounded in a single modality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICML 2026</p></details> |
| **[Inner Loop Inference for Pretrained Transformers: Unlocking Latent Capabilities Without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14759v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning architectures, and in particular Transformers, are conventionally viewed as a composition of layers. These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Singular Vectors of Attention Heads Align with Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13524v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying feature representations in language models is a central task in mechanistic interpretability. Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Highly Interpretable Prompt-Specific Circuits in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13483v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the internal circuits that language models use to solve tasks remains a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layer-Specific Fine-Tuning for Improved Negation Handling in Medical Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12498v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negation is a fundamental linguistic operation in clinical reporting, yet vision-language models (VLMs) frequently fail to distinguish affirmative from negated medical statements. To systematically characterize this limitation, we introduce a radiology-specific diagnostic benchmark that evaluates polarity sensitivity under controlled clinical conditions, revealing that common medical VLMs consistently confuse negated and non-negated findings. To enable learning beyond simple condition absence, we further construct a contextual clinical negation dataset that encodes structured claims and supports attribute-level negations involving location and severity. Building on these resources, we propose Negation-Aware Selective Training (NAST), an interpretability-guided adaptation method that uses causal tracing effects (CTEs) to modulate layer-wise gradient updates during fine-tuning. Rather than applying uniform learning rates, NAST scales each layer's update according to its causal contribution to negation processing, transforming mechanistic interpretability signals into a principled optimization rule. Experiments demonstrate improved discrimination of affirmative and negated clinical statements without degrading general vision-language alignment, highlighting the value of causal interpretability for targeted model adaptation in safety-critical medical settings.

| **[EVA: Towards a universal model of the immune system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10168v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effective application of foundation models to translational research in immune-mediated diseases requires multimodal patient-level representations that can capture complex phenotypes emerging from multicellular interactions. Yet most current biological foundation models focus only on single-cell resolution and are evaluated on technical metrics often disconnected from actual drug development tasks and challenges. Here, we introduce EVA, the first cross-species, multimodal foundation model of immunology and inflammation, a therapeutic area where shared pathogenic mechanisms create unique opportunities for transfer learning. EVA harmonizes transcriptomics data across species, platforms, and resolutions, and integrates histology data to produce rich, unified patient representations. We establish clear scaling laws, demonstrating that increasing model size and compute translates to improvements in both pretraining and downstream tasks performance. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite of 39 tasks spanning the drug development pipeline: zero-shot target efficacy and gene function prediction for discovery, cross-species or cross-diseases molecular perturbations for preclinical development, and patient stratification with treatment response prediction or disease activity prediction for clinical trials applications. We benchmark EVA against several state-of-the-art biological foundation models and baselines on these tasks, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on each task category. Using mechanistic interpretability, we further identify biological meaningful features, revealing intertwined representations across species and technologies. We release an open version of EVA for transcriptomics to accelerate research on immune-mediated diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Protein Circuit Tracing via Cross-layer Transcoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12026v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein language models (pLMs) have emerged as powerful predictors of protein structure and function. However, the computational circuits underlying their predictions remain poorly understood. Recent mechanistic interpretability methods decompose pLM representations into interpretable features, but they treat each layer independently and thus fail to capture cross-layer computation, limiting their ability to approximate the full model. We introduce ProtoMech, a framework for discovering computational circuits in pLMs using cross-layer transcoders that learn sparse latent representations jointly across layers to capture the model's full computational circuitry. Applied to the pLM ESM2, ProtoMech recovers 82-89% of the original performance on protein family classification and function prediction tasks. ProtoMech then identifies compressed circuits that use <1% of the latent space while retaining up to 79% of model accuracy, revealing correspondence with structural and functional motifs, including binding, signaling, and stability. Steering along these circuits enables high-fitness protein design, surpassing baseline methods in more than 70% of cases. These results establish ProtoMech as a principled framework for protein circuit tracing.</p></details> | 29 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20997v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some training-time regularization on single training instances, without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which can be leveraged to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs. (2) Feature untangling. Compared to typical methods, due to improved training strategy, BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 43 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Control Reinforcement Learning: Interpretable Token-Level Steering of LLMs via Sparse Autoencoder Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10437v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose language model activations into interpretable features, but existing methods reveal only which features activate, not which change model outputs when amplified. We introduce Control Reinforcement Learning (CRL), which trains a policy to select SAE features for steering at each token, producing interpretable intervention logs: the learned policy identifies features that change model outputs when amplified. Adaptive Feature Masking encourages diverse feature discovery while preserving singlefeature interpretability. The framework yields new analysis capabilities: branch point tracking locates tokens where feature choice determines output correctness; critic trajectory analysis separates policy limitations from value estimation errors; layer-wise comparison reveals syntactic features in early layers and semantic features in later layers. On Gemma 2 2B across MMLU, BBQ, GSM8K, HarmBench, and XSTest, CRL achieves improvements while providing per-token intervention logs. These results establish learned feature steering as a mechanistic interpretability tool that complements static feature analysis with dynamic intervention probes</p></details> |  |
| **[From Circuits to Dynamics: Understanding and Stabilizing Failure in 3D Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11130v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds underpins many applications spanning content creation and robotics. While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Make Everyone Happy?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11091v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the failure to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, leading to behaviors that diverge from human expectations in real-world settings where these dimensions must co-occur. Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication. Each prompt is paired with misaligned and aligned responses through two-stage rejection sampling to ensure quality. Second, we benchmark general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs on MISALIGNTRADE-revealing 12%-34% misalignment trade-offs across dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intrinsic Self-Correction in LLMs: Towards Explainable Prompting via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11924v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic self-correction refers to the phenomenon where a language model refines its own outputs purely through prompting, without external feedback or parameter updates. While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its mechanism remains unclear. We show that intrinsic self-correction functions by steering hidden representations along interpretable latent directions, as evidenced by both alignment analysis and activation interventions. To achieve this, we analyze intrinsic self-correction via the representation shift induced by prompting. In parallel, we construct interpretable latent directions with contrastive pairs and verify the causal effect of these directions via activation addition. Evaluating six open-source LLMs, our results demonstrate that prompt-induced representation shifts in text detoxification and text toxification consistently align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These findings suggest that representation steering is the mechanistic driver of intrinsic self-correction. Our analysis highlights that understanding model internals offers a direct route to analyzing the mechanisms of prompt-driven LLM behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Glioblastoma Tumor Heterogeneity Using Brain Inspired Topological Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11234v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prognosis for Glioblastoma (GBM) using deep learning (DL) is hindered by extreme spatial and structural heterogeneity. Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness.</p></details> |  |
