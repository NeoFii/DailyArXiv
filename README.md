| **[Beyond Static Pipelines: Learning Dynamic Workflows for Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15564v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-SQL has recently achieved impressive progress, yet remains difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. This gap stems from the reliance on single static workflows, fundamentally limiting scalability to out-of-distribution and long-tail scenarios. Instead of requiring users to select suitable methods through extensive experimentation, we attempt to enable systems to adaptively construct workflows at inference time. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that optimal dynamic policies consistently outperform the best static workflow, with performance gains fundamentally driven by heterogeneity across candidate workflows. Motivated by this, we propose SquRL, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning capability in adaptive workflow construction. We design a rule-based reward function and introduce two effective training mechanisms: dynamic actor masking to encourage broader exploration, and pseudo rewards to improve training efficiency. Experiments on widely-used Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate that dynamic workflow construction consistently outperforms the best static workflow methods, with especially pronounced gains on complex and out-of-distribution queries. The codes are available at https://github.com/Satissss/SquRL</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-as-Judge on a Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15481v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a cornerstone technique for evaluating large language models by leveraging LLM reasoning to score prompt-response pairs. Since LLM judgments are stochastic, practitioners commonly query each pair multiple times to estimate mean scores accurately. This raises a critical challenge: given a fixed computational budget $B$, how to optimally allocate queries across $K$ prompt-response pairs to minimize estimation error? % We present a principled variance-adaptive approach leveraging multi-armed bandit theory and concentration inequalities. Our method dynamically allocates queries based on estimated score variances, concentrating resources where uncertainty is highest. Further, our algorithm is shown to achieve a worst-case score-estimation error of $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^K σ_i^2}{B}}\right)$, $σ_i^2$ being the unknown score variance for pair $i \in [K]$ with near-optimal budget allocation. % Experiments on \emph{Summarize-From-Feedback} and \emph{HelpSteer2} demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms uniform allocation, reducing worst-case estimation error while maintaining identical budgets. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for efficient LLM evaluation with practical implications for AI safety, model alignment, and automated assessment at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-AI Interaction: Evaluating LLM Reasoning on Digital Logic Circuit included Graph Problems, in terms of creativity in design and analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15336v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by undergraduate students as on-demand tutors, yet their reliability on circuit- and diagram-based digital logic problems remains unclear. We present a human- AI study evaluating three widely used LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and Claude) on 10 undergraduate-level digital logic questions spanning non-standard counters, JK-based state transitions, timing diagrams, frequency division, and finite-state machines. Twenty-four students performed pairwise model comparisons, providing per-question judgments on (i) preferred model, (ii) perceived correctness, (iii) consistency, (iv) verbosity, and (v) confidence, along with global ratings of overall model quality, satisfaction across multiple dimensions (e.g., accuracy and clarity), and perceived mental effort required to verify answers. To benchmark technical validity, we applied an independent judge-based evaluation against official solutions for all ten questions, using strict correctness criteria. Results reveal a consistent gap between perceived helpfulness and formal correctness: for the most sequentially demanding problems (Q1- Q7), none of the evaluated LLMs matched the official answers, despite producing confident, well-structured explanations that students often rated favorably. Error analysis indicates that models frequently default to canonical textbook templates (e.g., standard ripple counters) and struggle to translate circuit structure into exact state evolution and timing behavior. These findings suggest that, without verification scaffolds, LLMs may be unreliable for core digital logic topics and can inadvertently reinforce misconceptions in undergraduate instruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedPlan: A Two-Stage RAG-Based System for Personalized Medical Plan Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17900v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent success in applying large language models (LLMs) to electronic health records (EHR), most systems focus primarily on assessment rather than treatment planning. We identify three critical limitations in current approaches: they generate treatment plans in a single pass rather than following the sequential reasoning process used by clinicians; they rarely incorporate patient-specific historical context; and they fail to effectively distinguish between subjective and objective clinical information. Motivated by the SOAP methodology (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), we introduce \ours{}, a novel framework that structures LLM reasoning to align with real-life clinician workflows. Our approach employs a two-stage architecture that first generates a clinical assessment based on patient symptoms and objective data, then formulates a structured treatment plan informed by this assessment and enriched with patient-specific information through retrieval-augmented generation. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in both assessment accuracy and treatment plan quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Diverse: Mitigating Diversity Illusion in Self-Play LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13103v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-play bootstraps LLM reasoning through an iterative Challenger-Solver loop: the Challenger is trained to generate questions that target the Solver's capabilities, and the Solver is optimized on the generated data to expand its reasoning skills. However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Gengsheng-Li/R-Diverse.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoTime: Memory-Augmented Temporal Knowledge Graph Enhanced Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13614v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities, but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However, existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time, enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse. Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2026 (WWW, 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Scalable LLM Reasoning Acceleration with Low-rank Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07861v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper, we propose Caprese, a resource-efficient distillation method to recover lost capabilities from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters, and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all of the reasoning capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>16% time-to-next-token reduction) while encouraging response brevity (up to 8.5% fewer tokens).</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Early Stopping for Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13935v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLMs have seen substantial improvement in reasoning capabilities, they also sometimes overthink, generating unnecessary reasoning steps, particularly under uncertainty, given ill-posed or ambiguous queries. We introduce statistically principled early stopping methods that monitor uncertainty signals during generation to mitigate this issue. Our first approach is parametric: it models inter-arrival times of uncertainty keywords as a renewal process and applies sequential testing for stopping. Our second approach is nonparametric and provides finite-sample guarantees on the probability of halting too early on well-posed queries. We conduct empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks across several domains and models. Our results indicate that uncertainty-aware early stopping can improve both efficiency and reliability in LLM reasoning, and we observe especially significant gains for math reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-State-Aware LLM Reasoning for Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13574v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) generation is a critical task in software security, serving as a cornerstone for vulnerability validation, false positive reduction, and patch verification. While directed fuzzing effectively drives path exploration, satisfying complex semantic constraints remains a persistent bottleneck in automated exploit generation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their semantic reasoning capabilities; however, existing LLM-based approaches lack sufficient grounding in concrete execution behavior, limiting their ability to generate precise PoVs. In this paper, we present DrillAgent, an agentic framework that reformulates PoV generation as an iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement process. To bridge the gap between static reasoning and dynamic execution, DrillAgent synergizes LLM-based semantic inference with feedback from concrete program states. The agent analyzes the target code to hypothesize inputs, observes execution behavior, and employs a novel mechanism to translate low-level execution traces into source-level constraints. This closed-loop design enables the agent to incrementally align its input generation with the precise requirements of the vulnerability. We evaluate DrillAgent on SEC-bench, a large-scale benchmark of real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that DrillAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM agent baselines under fixed budget constraints, solving up to 52.8% more CVE tasks than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the necessity of execution-state-aware reasoning for reliable PoV generation in complex software systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 1.0 (13 pages, 7 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Think Deep, Not Just Long: Measuring LLM Reasoning Effort via Deep-Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13517v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, recent findings suggest that raw token counts are unreliable proxies for reasoning quality: increased generation length does not consistently correlate with accuracy and may instead signal "overthinking," leading to performance degradation. In this work, we quantify inference-time effort by identifying deep-thinking tokens -- tokens where internal predictions undergo significant revisions in deeper model layers prior to convergence. Across four challenging mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, and GPQA-diamond) and a diverse set of reasoning-focused models (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3), we show that deep-thinking ratio (the proportion of deep-thinking tokens in a generated sequence) exhibits a robust and consistently positive correlation with accuracy, substantially outperforming both length-based and confidence-based baselines. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Think@n, a test-time scaling strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios. We demonstrate that Think@n matches or exceeds standard self-consistency performance while significantly reducing inference costs by enabling the early rejection of unpromising generations based on short prefixes.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Reproduction of Networking Research Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21074v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reproduction is a cornerstone of scientific validity, yet it remains a formidable challenge in computer networking research due to the scarcity of open-source implementations and the complexity of heterogeneous system architectures. While Large Language Models have demonstrated potential in code generation, existing code generation frameworks often fail to address the long-context constraints and intricate logical dependencies required to reproduce network systems from academic papers. To facilitate result reproduction, we introduce \emph{RepLLM}, an end-to-end multi-agent framework designed to automate the transformation of network research into executable code. RepLLM features a novel collaborative architecture comprising four specialized agents -- Content Parsing, Architecture Design, Code Generation, and Audit \& Repair -- coordinated through an explicit \textit{Shared Memory} mechanism to ensure global context consistency. With the enhancement of Chain-of-Thought LLM reasoning and a sandbox-isolated static-dynamic debugging methodology, our framework effectively resolves semantic discrepancies and runtime errors. Extensive evaluations on representative papers from SIGCOMM and NSDI demonstrate that RepLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating compile-ready and logically correct systems. Results further demonstrate that RepLLM facilitates the reproduction of 80\% of the original benchmarks with only four hours of human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[VI-CuRL: Stabilizing Verifier-Independent RL Reasoning via Confidence-Guided Variance Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12579v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning, yet its reliance on external verifiers limits its scalability. Recent findings suggest that RLVR primarily functions by eliciting latent capabilities, motivating the development of verifier-free algorithms. However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers. By prioritizing high-confidence samples, VI-CuRL effectively manages the bias-variance trade-off, specifically targeting the reduction of action and problem variance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that our estimator guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness. Empirically, VI-CuRL promotes stability and consistently outperforms verifier-independent baselines across six challenging benchmarks with/without verifiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning to Rank: An End-to-End Solution for Exploiting Large Language Models for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12530v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are tasked to infer users' evolving preferences and rank items aligned with their intents, which calls for in-depth reasoning beyond pattern-based scoring. Recent efforts start to leverage large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, but how to effectively optimize the model for improved recommendation utility is still under explored. In this work, we propose Reasoning to Rank, an end-to-end training framework that internalizes recommendation utility optimization into the learning of step-by-step reasoning in LLMs. To avoid position bias in LLM reasoning and enable direct optimization of the reasoning process, our framework performs reasoning at the user-item level and employs reinforcement learning for end-to-end training of the LLM. Experiments on three Amazon datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset showed consistent gains over strong conventional and LLM-based solutions. Extensive in-depth analyses validate the necessity of the key components in the proposed framework and shed lights on the future developments of this line of work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLM Reasoning Beyond Correctness and CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18134v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Current evaluations reward models' correct standalone answers-but correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. We argue that reasoning should be understood not as a static chain of steps but as a dynamic trajectory in which ideas interact, clash, and evolve into integrated insights. Building on the philosophical tradition of dialectics, we introduce SIEV, a structured evaluation framework that assesses reasoning through explicit thesis-antithesis-synthesis interactions. SIEV produces interpretable trajectories that highlight key properties of reasoning-robustness to challenge, adaptability under conflict, and synthesis across competing viewpoints-dimensions that conventional correctness-based metrics cannot capture. Empirical results on GSM and MMLU demonstrate substantial gaps in the reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art models: for example, GPT-5-chat loses more than 40 points (out of 100) on GSM when evaluated through SIEV's process-oriented lens. By shifting focus from what answer a model gives to how it arrives there, SIEV enables a more transparent and principled distinction between structured reasoning and surface-level pattern generation offering a clearer foundation for assessing and understanding the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Demo Is All It Takes: Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs from A Single Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18382v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) show promise for robotic task planning but often struggle to guarantee correctness in long-horizon problems. Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by grounding symbolic plans in low-level execution, yet it relies heavily on manually engineered planning domains. To improve long-horizon planning reliability and reduce human intervention, we present Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs (PDDLLM), a framework that automatically induces symbolic predicates and actions directly from demonstration trajectories by combining LLM reasoning with physical simulation roll-outs. Unlike prior domain-inference methods that rely on partially predefined or language descriptions of planning domains, PDDLLM constructs domains without manual domain initialization and automatically integrates them with motion planners to produce executable plans, enhancing long-horizon planning automation. Across 1,200 tasks in nine environments, PDDLLM outperforms six LLM-based planning baselines, achieving at least 20\% higher success rates, reduced token costs, and successful deployment on multiple physical robot platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[FlowMind: Execute-Summarize for Structured Workflow Generation from LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11782v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Implicit Advantage Symmetry: Why GRPO Struggles with Exploration and Difficulty Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05548v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Generalization from Learned Skills via CoT Training: A Theoretical and Structural Analysis for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04667v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training has markedly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet the mechanisms by which CoT training enhances generalization remain inadequately understood. In this work, we demonstrate that compositional generalization is fundamental: models systematically combine simpler learned skills during CoT training to address novel and more complex problems. Through a theoretical and structural analysis, we formalize this process: 1) Theoretically, the information-theoretic generalization bounds through distributional divergence can be decomposed into in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) components. Specifically, the non-CoT models fail on OOD tasks due to unseen compositional patterns, whereas CoT-trained models achieve strong generalization by composing previously learned skills. In addition, controlled experiments and real-world validation confirm that CoT training accelerates convergence and enhances generalization from ID to both ID and OOD scenarios while maintaining robust performance even with tolerable noise. 2) Structurally, CoT training internalizes reasoning into a two-stage compositional circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the explicit reasoning steps during training. Notably, CoT-trained models resolve intermediate results at shallower layers compared to non-CoT counterparts, freeing up deeper layers to specialize in subsequent reasoning steps. A key insight is that CoT training teaches models how to think-by fostering compositional reasoning-rather than merely what to think, through the provision of correct answers alone. This paper offers valuable insights for designing CoT strategies to enhance LLMs' reasoning robustness.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[When Audio-LLMs Don't Listen: A Cross-Linguistic Study of Modality Arbitration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11488v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When audio and text conflict, speech-enabled language models follow the text 10 times more often than when arbitrating between two text sources, even when explicitly instructed to trust the audio. Using ALME, a benchmark of 57,602 controlled audio-text conflict stimuli across 8 languages, we find that Gemini 2.0 Flash exhibits 16.6\% text dominance under audio-text conflict versus 1.6\% under text-text conflict with identical reliability cues. This gap is not explained by audio quality: audio-only accuracy (97.2\%) exceeds cascade accuracy (93.9\%), indicating audio embeddings preserve more information than text transcripts. We propose that text dominance reflects an asymmetry not in information content but in arbitration accessibility: how easily the model can reason over competing representations. This framework explains otherwise puzzling findings. Forcing transcription before answering increases text dominance (19\% to 33\%), sacrificing audio's information advantage without improving accessibility. Framing text as ``deliberately corrupted'' reduces text dominance by 80\%. A fine-tuning ablation provides interventional evidence: training only the audio projection layer increases text dominance (+26.5\%), while LoRA on the language model halves it ($-$23.9\%), localizing text dominance to the LLM's reasoning rather than the audio encoder. Experiments across four state-of-the-art audio-LLMs and 8 languages show consistent trends with substantial cross-linguistic and cross-model variation, establishing modality arbitration as a distinct reliability dimension not captured by standard speech benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 18 tables, 8 languages, benchmark and code at https://github.com/jb1999/alme-benchmark</p></details> |
| **[Logical Structure as Knowledge: Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Structured Logical Knowledge Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attributed to training data quality rather than mere parameter scaling. However, existing data-centric paradigms often equate quality with factuality or diversity and ignore the internal logical complexity of training samples. In this work, we propose that natural language harbors Structured Logical Knowledge manifested through entailment relationships and logical topologies. To quantify this, we introduce Structured Logical Knowledge Density (SLKD), a novel metric that measures logical information content by decomposing natural language into executable predicates and logical primitives. Our analysis reveals a significant logical disparity in current datasets where sparse logical signals predominate. Consequently, we propose a density aware re-cognizing optimization strategy that prioritizes high-density logical samples to enhance with the LLM's reasoning ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances reasoning performance and generalization without increasing total data volume. These results, further validated within a reinforcement learning framework, suggest that elevating logical density is more critical than expanding data scale for realizing the full cognitive potential of LLMs. The released code is available in the Appendix C.</p></details> |  |

| **[FAST-EQA: Efficient Embodied Question Answering with Global and Local Region Relevancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15813v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Question Answering (EQA) combines visual scene understanding, goal-directed exploration, spatial and temporal reasoning under partial observability. A central challenge is to confine physical search to question-relevant subspaces while maintaining a compact, actionable memory of observations. Furthermore, for real-world deployment, fast inference time during exploration is crucial. We introduce FAST-EQA, a question-conditioned framework that (i) identifies likely visual targets, (ii) scores global regions of interest to guide navigation, and (iii) employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning over visual memory to answer confidently. FAST-EQA maintains a bounded scene memory that stores a fixed-capacity set of region-target hypotheses and updates them online, enabling robust handling of both single and multi-target questions without unbounded growth. To expand coverage efficiently, a global exploration policy treats narrow openings and doors as high-value frontiers, complementing local target seeking with minimal computation. Together, these components focus the agent's attention, improve scene coverage, and improve answer reliability while running substantially faster than prior approaches. On HMEQA and EXPRESS-Bench, FAST-EQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, while performing competitively on OpenEQA and MT-HM3D.</p></details> | WACV 2026 |
| **[Recursive Concept Evolution for Compositional Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15725v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models achieve strong performance on many complex reasoning tasks, yet their accuracy degrades sharply on benchmarks that require compositional reasoning, including ARC-AGI-2, GPQA, MATH, BBH, and HLE. Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Veracity Inference for Identifying Errors in Stepwise Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11824v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address this, we propose to augment each reasoning step in a CoT with a latent veracity (or correctness) variable. To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Veracity Search (VS), a discrete search algorithm over veracity assignments. It performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior distribution over latent veracity values by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient inference-time verification method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an Amortized Veracity Inference (AVI) machine by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. AVI generalizes VS, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that VS reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA), mathematical (GSM8K), and commonsense (CommonsenseQA) reasoning benchmarks, with AVI achieving comparable zero-shot accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of latent veracity inference for providing feedback during self-correction and self-improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[NPG-Muse: Scaling Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH) graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are the core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long-CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. The resulting NPG-Muse-series models exhibit substantially enhanced Long CoT reasoning capabilities, achieving consistent gains across mathematics, coding, logical, and graph reasoning benchmarks. NPG-Muse-7B even surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLM post-training.

| **[On the Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs for Simple Visual Planning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15460v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating reasoning in large language models and large vision-language models has recently led to significant improvement of their capabilities. However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) framework as an integrated processing methodology to enhance the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated findings for jaw cysts in dental panoramic radiographs. Dental panoramic radiographs with jaw cysts were used to implement a 10-step integrated processing framework incorporating image analysis, structured data generation, tooth number extraction, consistency checking, and iterative regeneration. The framework functioned as an external validation mechanism for GPT outputs. Performance was compared against the conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure, borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures, and tooth number. The SLSO framework improved output accuracy for multiple items compared to the CoT method, with the most notable improvements observed in tooth number identification, tooth movement detection, and root resorption assessment. In successful cases, consistently structured outputs were achieved after up to five regenerations. The framework enforced explicit negative finding descriptions and suppressed hallucinations, although accurate identification of extensive lesions spanning multiple teeth remained limited. This investigation established the feasibility of the proposed integrated processing methodology and provided a foundation for future validation studies with larger, more diverse datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised manuscript; supplementary materials added.

Humans easily infer emotions from situations or facial expressions, situations from emotions, and do a variety of other affective cognition. How adept is modern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing affective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory, we generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals, emotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation models (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully selected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with human intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some conditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human judgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought reasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like understanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privileged Information Distillation for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04942v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, which typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable, but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically, we find that π-Distill and, in some cases, OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract border should have been purple</p></details> |

Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed in alphabetical order.

| **[The Potential of CoT for Reasoning: A Closer Look at Trace Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14903v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a de-facto standard technique to elicit reasoning-like responses from large language models (LLMs), allowing them to spell out individual steps before giving a final answer. While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnosing Knowledge Conflict in Multimodal Long-Chain Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14518v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in long chain-of-thought reasoning often fail when different knowledge sources provide conflicting signals. We formalize these failures under a unified notion of knowledge conflict, distinguishing input-level objective conflict from process-level effective conflict. Through probing internal representations, we reveal that: (I) Linear Separability: different conflict types are explicitly encoded as linearly separable features rather than entangled; (II) Depth Localization: conflict signals concentrate in mid-to-late layers, indicating a distinct processing stage for conflict encoding; (III) Hierarchical Consistency: aggregating noisy token-level signals along trajectories robustly recovers input-level conflict types; and (IV) Directional Asymmetry: reinforcing the model's implicit source preference under conflict is far easier than enforcing the opposite source. Our findings provide a mechanism-level view of multimodal reasoning under knowledge conflict and enable principled diagnosis and control of long-CoT failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Slow Thinking Faster: Compressing LLM Chain-of-Thought via Step Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03346v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric that quantifies \emph{the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps} to identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning, which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly improves LLM inference efficiency while preserving accuracy, paving the way for more scalable LLM deployments and a better understanding of their internal reasoning. The code and data are released in https://github.com/staymylove/COT_Compresstion_via_Step_entropy.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2026 |
| **[Measuring and Mitigating Post-hoc Rationalization in Reverse Chain-of-Thought Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14469v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse Chain-of-Thought Generation (RCG) synthesizes reasoning traces from query-answer pairs, but runs the risk of producing post-hoc rationalizations: when models can see the answer during generation, the answer serves as a cognitive anchor that shapes the entire explanation. We formalize this phenomenon through a three-level measurement hierarchy: lexical, entropic, and probabilistic anchoring, each captures surface artifacts, entropy dynamics, and latent answer dependence, respectively. We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence. Experiments across open-ended reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SSR-D achieves up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precedent-Informed Reasoning: Mitigating Overthinking in Large Reasoning Models via Test-Time Precedent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14451v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffers from inefficient long chain-of-thought traces with redundant self-exploration and validation, which inflate computational costs and even degrade performance. Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Broken Chains: The Cost of Incomplete Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14444v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning-specialized models like OpenAI's 5.1 and DeepSeek-V3.2 allocate substantial inference compute to extended chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, yet reasoning tokens incur significant costs. How do different reasoning modalities of code, natural language, hybrid, or none do perform under token constraints? We introduce a framework that constrains models to reason exclusively through code, comments, both, or neither, then systematically ablates token budgets to 10\%, 30\%, 50\%, and 70\% of optimal. We evaluate four frontier models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Flash, DeepSeek-V3.2, Grok 4.1) across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, GSM8K, HMMT). Our findings reveal: (1) \textbf{truncated reasoning can hurt} as DeepSeek-V3.2 achieves 53\% with no reasoning but only 17\% with truncated CoT at 50\% budget; (2) \textbf{code degrades gracefully} as Gemini's comments collapse to 0\% while code maintains 43-47\%; (3) \textbf{hybrid reasoning underperforms} single modalities; (4) \textbf{robustness is model-dependent} as Grok maintains 80-90\% at 30\% budget where OpenAI and DeepSeek collapse to 7-27\%. These results suggest incomplete reasoning chains actively mislead models, with implications for deploying reasoning-specialized systems under resource constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Thinking with Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12916v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a multimodal extension of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Thinking with Images (TWI) has recently emerged as a promising avenue to enhance the reasoning capability of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which generates interleaved CoT by incorporating visual cues into the textual reasoning process. However, the success of existing TWI methods heavily relies on the assumption that interleaved image-text CoTs are faultless, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of multimodal understanding. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI). In brief, RTWI estimates the reliability of visual cues and textual CoT in a unified text-centric manner and accordingly employs robust filtering and voting modules to prevent NT from contaminating the final answer. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks verify the effectiveness of RTWI against NT.</p></details> | 26 pages, 19 figures |

In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning about the Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks. To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, along with annotated legal references and explanations written by human experts.

However, forcing these models to textually characterize imperceptible low-level tampering traces inevitably leads to hallucinations, as linguistic modalities are insufficient to capture such fine-grained pixel-level inconsistencies. To overcome this, we propose ForgeryVCR, a framework that incorporates a forensic toolbox to materialize imperceptible traces into explicit visual intermediates via Visual-Centric Reasoning. To enable efficient tool utilization, we introduce a Strategic Tool Learning post-training paradigm, encompassing gain-driven trajectory construction for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization guided by a tool utility reward. This paradigm empowers the MLLM to act as a proactive decision-maker, learning to spontaneously invoke multi-view reasoning paths including local zoom-in for fine-grained inspection and the analysis of invisible inconsistencies in compression history, noise residuals, and frequency domains. Extensive experiments reveal that ForgeryVCR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both detection and localization tasks, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness with minimal tool redundancy.

We explore the potential for steganographic CoT -- where models hide secret reasoning within innocuous text -- to inform risk assessment and deployment policies. We systematically evaluate the limits of steganographic capabilities across 28 models, ranging from past generations to the current frontier. We measure monitor evasion, refusal rates, encoding fidelity, and hidden task accuracy across four datasets, comparing steganographic acrostics against plain reasoning and filler-token baselines. We find that current models cannot yet sustain hidden reasoning for complex math and arithmetic tasks. However, in a simplified counting experiment, Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy on the hidden task, demonstrating nascent capability. Notably, in rare cases (<1%), GPT-5.2 might refuse steganographic instructions while simultaneously complying with them. Our findings underscore the need for continuous evaluation of steganographic risks. This study provides a methodology to preemptively detect and prevent hidden reasoning that might empower misaligned scheming and deceptive behavior.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stroke Lesions as a Rosetta Stone for Language Model Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04074v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet methods to verify which model components are truly necessary for language function remain limited. Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.</p></details> | 45 pages, 17 figures |

Existing data selection methods either build expensive gradient datastores or assign static scores from a weak proxy, largely ignoring evolving uncertainty, and thus missing a key source of LLM interpretability. We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Shared Geometry of Difficulty in Multilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12731v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting problem-difficulty in large language models (LLMs) refers to estimating how difficult a task is according to the model itself, typically by training linear probes on its internal representations. In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-SAM-LLM: Large Language Models as Causal Reasoners for Robust Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03585v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains. This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.</p></details> |  |

Initial findings highlight the influence of model sophistication on performance, offering insights into the models capabilities to engage in meaningful social interactions and adapt behaviors in human-like ways. This research advances the understanding of LLMs potential to replicate or diverge from human cognitive functions, paving the way for more nuanced and empathetic human-machine collaborations.</p></details> |  |

To investigate this, human participants and four instruction-tuned LLMs of different sizes (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, and Mistral-7B) rated 240 dialogue-based sentences representing six linguistic traits: conventionality, sarcasm, funny, emotional, idiomacy, and slang. Each of the 240 sentences was paired with 40 interpretive questions, and both humans and LLMs rated these sentences on a 10-point Likert scale. Results indicated that humans and LLMs aligned at the surface level with humans, but diverged significantly at the representational level, especially in interpreting figurative sentences involving idioms and Gen Z slang. GPT-4 most closely approximates human representational patterns, while all models struggle with context-dependent and socio-pragmatic expressions like sarcasm, slang, and idiomacy.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce a Neuro-Symbolic Compliance Framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to enable formal verifiability and optimization-based compliance correction. The LLM interprets statutes and enforcement cases to generate SMT constraints, while the solver enforces consistency and computes the minimal factual modification required to restore legality when penalties arise. Unlike transparency-oriented methods, our approach emphasizes logic-driven optimization, delivering verifiable, legally consistent reasoning rather than post-hoc explanation. Evaluated on 87 enforcement cases from Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), the system attains 86.2% correctness in SMT code generation, improves reasoning efficiency by over 100x, and consistently corrects violations-establishing a preliminary foundation for optimization-based compliance applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 tables, 3 figures, accepted by the 2nd ACM AIware Conference</p></details> |
| **[LLM Interpretability with Identifiable Temporal-Instantaneous Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23323v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling, instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Control with Large Language Models for Language-Guided Spatial Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17321v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have recently become effective tools for language-conditioned control in embodied systems, instability, slow convergence, and hallucinated actions continue to limit their direct application to continuous control. A modular neuro-symbolic control framework that clearly distinguishes between low-level motion execution and high-level semantic reasoning is proposed in this work. While a lightweight neural delta controller performs bounded, incremental actions in continuous space, a locally deployed LLM interprets symbolic tasks. We assess the suggested method in a planar manipulation setting with spatial relations between objects specified by language. Numerous tasks and local language models, such as Mistral, Phi, and LLaMA-3.2, are used in extensive experiments to compare LLM-only control, neural-only control, and the suggested LLM+DL framework. In comparison to LLM-only baselines, the results show that the neuro-symbolic integration consistently increases both success rate and efficiency, achieving average step reductions exceeding 70% and speedups of up to 8.83x while remaining robust to language model quality. The suggested framework enhances interpretability, stability, and generalization without any need of reinforcement learning or costly rollouts by controlling the LLM to symbolic outputs and allocating uninterpreted execution to a neural controller trained on artificial geometric data. These outputs show empirically that neuro-symbolic decomposition offers a scalable and principled way to integrate language understanding with ongoing control, this approach promotes the creation of dependable and effective language-guided embodied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trust Me, I Know This Function: Hijacking LLM Static Analysis using Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17361v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA). We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective against basic and reasoning models, but are also transferable across model families (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), and universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of code-oriented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verification-Guided Context Optimization for Tool Calling via Hierarchical LLMs-as-Editors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13860v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external environments through tool invocation, providing a practical way to overcome the limitations of pretraining. However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Workshop on Agentic AI Benchmarks and Applications for Enterprise Tasks</p></details> |
| **[Visualizing token importance for black-box language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11573v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of auditing black-box large language models (LLMs) to ensure they behave reliably when deployed in production settings, particularly in high-stakes domains such as legal, medical, and regulatory compliance. Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cache What Lasts: Token Retention for Memory-Bounded KV Cache in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03324v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory and computation remain core bottlenecks in long-horizon LLM inference due to the quadratic cost of self-attention and the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training. Our code and data will be open source to encourage future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 main.

A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness. Compared with prior LLM-based systems, CoMuRoS uniquely demonstrates runtime, event-driven replanning on physical robots, delivering robust, flexible multi-robot and human-robot collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

| **[HSKBenchmark: Modeling and Benchmarking Chinese Second Language Acquisition in Large Language Models through Curriculum Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15574v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language acquisition is vital to revealing the nature of human language intelligence and has recently emerged as a promising perspective for improving the interpretability of large language models (LLMs). However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

This project proposes an interdisciplinary study of linguistic errors produced by native Spanish speakers, with the aim of analyzing how current large language models (LLM) interpret, reproduce, or correct them. The research integrates three core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand the nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within real-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing (NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A purpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as the foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI models such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their ability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior. The project contributes not only to the understanding of Spanish as a native language but also to the development of NLP systems that are more cognitively informed and capable of engaging with the imperfect, variable, and often ambiguous nature of real human language.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

However, computing Shapley values exactly requires $2^d$ game evaluations for a model with $d$ features. Lundberg and Lee's KernelSHAP algorithm has emerged as a leading method for avoiding this exponential cost. KernelSHAP approximates Shapley values by approximating the game as a linear function, which is fit using a small number of game evaluations for random feature subsets. In this work, we extend KernelSHAP by approximating the game via higher degree polynomials, which capture non-linear interactions between features. Our resulting PolySHAP method yields empirically better Shapley value estimates for various benchmark datasets, and we prove that these estimates are consistent. Moreover, we connect our approach to paired sampling (antithetic sampling), a ubiquitous modification to KernelSHAP that improves empirical accuracy. We prove that paired sampling outputs exactly the same Shapley value approximations as second-order PolySHAP, without ever fitting a degree 2 polynomial. To the best of our knowledge, this finding provides the first strong theoretical justification for the excellent practical performance of the paired sampling heuristic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2026: https://openreview.net/forum?id=M19J8UGguq</p></details> |

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans.</p></details> | AAAI-2026 |
| **[A unified framework for evaluating the robustness of machine-learning interpretability for prospect risking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14430v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In geophysics, hydrocarbon prospect risking involves assessing the risks associated with hydrocarbon exploration by integrating data from various sources. Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of "importance" and "relevance" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data. This robustness test gives us deeper insights into the models capabilities to handle erronous data and which XAI module works best in pair with which model for our dataset for hydorcarbon indication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centered LLM-Agent System for Detecting Anomalous Digital Asset Transactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20102v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in digital-asset transactions. The system integrates three cognitively aligned roles: Rule Abstraction, Evidence Scoring, and Expert-Style Justification. These roles operate in a conversational workflow that enables non-experts to express analytical intent in natural language, inspect structured risk evidence, and obtain traceable, context-aware reasoning. Implemented with an open-source, web-based interface, HCLA translates user intent into explicit analytical rules, applies classical anomaly detectors to quantify evidential risk, and reconstructs expert-style justifications grounded in observable transactional signals. Experiments on a cryptocurrency anomaly dataset show that, while the underlying detector achieves strong predictive accuracy, HCLA substantially improves interpretability, interaction, and decision transparency. Importantly, HCLA is not designed to explain a black-box model in the conventional XAI sense. Instead, we reconstruct a traceable expert reasoning process that aligns algorithmic evidence with regulatory and investigative judgment. By explicitly separating evidence scoring from expert-style justification, the framework emphasizes accountability beyond explainability and addresses practical requirements for regulatory, audit, and compliance-driven financial forensics. We describe the system architecture, closed-loop interaction design, datasets, evaluation protocol, and limitations. We argue that a human-in-the-loop reasoning reconstruction paradigm is essential for achieving transparency, accountability, and trust in high-stakes financial environments.

Explainable AI (XAI) can contribute when shifting its traditional role from justification (explaining decisions) to exploration (explaining possibilities). Contextual understanding is essential for supporting embodied creativity. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are fundamentally limited, however, by their reliance on disembodied data. We propose Pluri-perspectivism as a framework for XAI, to bridge the epistemological gap between human and machine, and promote creative exploration. It is a pragmatic, action-oriented solution to guide the system, repurposing XAI methods such as the Rashomon Technique. This facilitates exploring a spectrum of creative possibilities, and the exchange of 'perspectives' between human and machine. Using Pluri-perspectivism as a framework for XAI, we can reintroduce productive friction and support human agency in human-machine creative collaborations.</p></details> |  |

This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models. Previous studies demonstrating successful XAI application should be reevaluated with respect to a possibly spurious concurrency of feature salience and informativeness, and workflows using feature attribution methods as building blocks should be scrutinised.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable XAI: Relating Understanding Across Domains with Explanation Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13675v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on explaining a single application, but when encountering related applications, users may rely on their prior understanding from previous explanations. This leads to either overgeneralization and AI overreliance, or burdensome independent memorization. Indeed, related decision tasks can share explanatory factors, but with some notable differences; e.g., body mass index (BMI) affects the risks for heart disease and diabetes at the same rate, but chest pain is more indicative of heart disease. Similarly, models using different attributes for the same task still share signals; e.g., temperature and pressure affect air pollution but in opposite directions due to the ideal gas law. Leveraging transfer of learning, we propose Transferable XAI to enable users to transfer understanding across related domains by explaining the relationship between domain explanations using a general affine transformation framework applied to linear factor explanations. The framework supports explanation transfer across various domain types: translation for data subspace (subsuming prior work on Incremental XAI), scaling for decision task, and mapping for attributes. Focusing on task and attributes domain types, in formative and summative user studies, we investigated how well participants could understand AI decisions from one domain to another. Compared to single-domain and domain-independent explanations, Transferable XAI was the most helpful for understanding the second domain, leading to the best decision faithfulness, factor recall, and ability to relate explanations between domains. This framework contributes to improving the reusability of explanations across related AI applications by explaining factor relationships between subspaces, tasks, and attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, accepted by IUI2026</p></details> |

This dependency puts them at risk of fraud and exploitation. To address these challenges, we first build a new Bangladeshi banknote dataset that includes both controlled and real-world scenarios, ensuring a more comprehensive and diverse representation. Next, to enhance the dataset's robustness, we incorporate four additional datasets, including public benchmarks, to cover various complexities and improve the model's generalization. To overcome the limitations of current recognition models, we propose a novel hybrid CNN architecture that combines MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNetB0 for efficient feature extraction. This is followed by an effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to improve performance while keeping computational costs low, making the system suitable for resource-constrained devices. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 97.95% accuracy on controlled datasets, 92.84% on complex backgrounds, and 94.98% accuracy when combining all datasets. The model's performance is thoroughly evaluated using five-fold cross-validation and seven metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa, MCC, and AUC. Additionally, explainable AI methods like LIME and SHAP are incorporated to enhance transparency and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PAKDD 2026</p></details> |
| **[X-SYS: A Reference Architecture for Interactive Explanation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12748v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explainable AI (XAI) research community has proposed numerous technical methods, yet deploying explainability as systems remains challenging: Interactive explanation systems require both suitable algorithms and system capabilities that maintain explanation usability across repeated queries, evolving models and data, and governance constraints. We argue that operationalizing XAI requires treating explainability as an information systems problem where user interaction demands induce specific system requirements. We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability. Together, this work provides a reusable blueprint and concrete instantiation for interactive explanation systems supporting end-to-end design under operational constraints.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Predicting Open Source Software Sustainability with Deep Temporal Neural Hierarchical Architectures and Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09064v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Source Software (OSS) projects follow diverse lifecycle trajectories shaped by evolving patterns of contribution, coordination, and community engagement. Understanding these trajectories is essential for stakeholders seeking to assess project organization and health at scale. However, prior work has largely relied on static or aggregated metrics, such as project age or cumulative activity, providing limited insight into how OSS sustainability unfolds over time. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical predictive framework that models OSS projects as belonging to distinct lifecycle stages grounded in established socio-technical categorizations of OSS development. Rather than treating sustainability solely as project longevity, these lifecycle stages operationalize sustainability as a multidimensional construct integrating contribution activity, community participation, and maintenance dynamics. The framework combines engineered tabular indicators with 24-month temporal activity sequences and employs a multi-stage classification pipeline to distinguish lifecycle stages associated with different coordination and participation regimes. To support transparency, we incorporate explainable AI techniques to examine the relative contribution of feature categories to model predictions. Evaluated on a large corpus of OSS repositories, the proposed approach achieves over 94\% overall accuracy in lifecycle stage classification. Attribution analyses consistently identify contribution activity and community-related features as dominant signals, highlighting the central role of collective participation dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This inconsistency hinders understanding, and because explanations are often read-only, users lack the control to improve alignment. We propose making XAI editable, allowing users to write rules to improve control and gain deeper understanding through the generation effect of active learning. We developed CoExplain, leveraging a neural network for universal representation and symbolic rules for intuitive reasoning on interpretable attributes. CoExplain explains the neural network with a faithful proxy decision tree, parses user-written rules as an equivalent neural network graph, and collaboratively optimizes the decision tree. In a user study (N=43), CoExplain and manually editable XAI improved user understanding and model alignment compared to read-only XAI. CoExplain was easier to use with fewer edits and less time. This work contributes Editable XAI for bidirectional AI alignment, improving understanding and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Generative AI for Human Understanding: Meta-Requirements and Design Principles for Explanatory AI as a new Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06352v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly support decision-making across critical domains, yet current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency over human comprehension. While XAI methods reveal computational processes for model validation and audit, end users require explanations integrating domain knowledge, contextual reasoning, and professional frameworks. This disconnect reveals a fundamental design challenge: existing AI explanation approaches fail to address how practitioners actually need to understand and act upon recommendations. This paper introduces Explanatory AI as a complementary paradigm where AI systems leverage generative and multimodal capabilities to serve as explanatory partners for human understanding. Unlike traditional XAI that answers "How did the algorithm decide?" for validation purposes, Explanatory AI addresses "Why does this make sense?" for practitioners making informed decisions. Through theory-informed design, we synthesize multidisciplinary perspectives on explanation from cognitive science, communication research, and education with empirical evidence from healthcare contexts and AI expert interviews. Our analysis identifies five dimensions distinguishing Explanatory AI from traditional XAI: explanatory purpose (from diagnostic to interpretive sense-making), communication mode (from static technical to dynamic narrative interaction), epistemic stance (from algorithmic correspondence to contextual plausibility), adaptivity (from uniform design to personalized accessibility), and cognitive design (from information overload to cognitively aligned delivery). We derive five meta-requirements specifying what systems must achieve and formulate ten design principles prescribing how to build them.</p></details> |  |

So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,9 figures, 2025 IEEE International Women in Engineering (WIE) Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (WIECON-ECE)</p></details> |

In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Computing Conditional Shapley Values Using Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09489v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapley values have become a cornerstone of explainable AI, but they are computationally expensive to use, especially when features are dependent. Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime. We discuss further improvements and how tabular foundation models can be better adapted specifically for conditional Shapley value estimation.</p></details> |  |

We recorded a new dataset (HLS-CMDS) and developed several AI models, including generative AI methods based on large language models (LLMs) for guided separation, explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret latent representations, variational autoencoders (VAEs) for waveform separation, a chemistry-inspired non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for clustering, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to detect abnormal physiological patterns. The performance of these AI models depends on the quality of the recorded signals. Therefore, this thesis also reviews the biosensing technologies used to capture biomedical data. It summarizes developments in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) acoustic sensors and quantum biosensors, such as quantum dots and nitrogen-vacancy centers. It further outlines the transition from electronic integrated circuits (EICs) to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and early progress toward integrated quantum photonics (IQP) for chip-based biosensing. Together, these studies show how AI and next-generation sensors can support more intelligent diagnostic systems for future healthcare.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[From Features to Actions: Explainability in Traditional and Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06841v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

If this condition is not diagnosed in a timely manner and appropriately treated, it can lead to serious complications such as decreased consciousness, permanent neurological disabilities, or even death.The primary aim of this study is to detect the occurrence or non-occurrence of ICH, followed by determining the type of subdural hemorrhage (SDH). These tasks are framed as two separate binary classification problems. By adding two layers to the co-scale convolutional attention (CCA) classifier architecture, we introduce a novel approach for ICH detection. In the first layer, after extracting features from different slices of computed tomography (CT) scan images, we combine these features and select the 50 components that capture the highest variance in the data, considering them as informative features. We then assess the discriminative power of these features using the bootstrap forest algorithm, discarding those that lack sufficient discriminative ability between different classes. This algorithm explicitly determines the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, assisting us in developing an explainable AI model. The features feed into a boosting neural network as a latent feature space. In the second layer, we introduce a novel uncertainty-based fuzzy integral operator to fuse information from different CT scan slices. This operator, by accounting for the dependencies between consecutive slices, significantly improves detection accuracy.</p></details> |  |

A Neuron-level Dissection of a General-purpose Audio Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15307v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we analyze the internal representations of a general-purpose audio self-supervised learning (SSL) model from a neuron-level perspective. Despite their strong empirical performance as feature extractors, the internal mechanisms underlying the robust generalization of SSL audio models remain unclear. Drawing on the framework of mechanistic interpretability, we identify and examine class-specific neurons by analyzing conditional activation patterns across diverse tasks. Our analysis reveals that SSL models foster the emergence of class-specific neurons that provide extensive coverage across novel task classes. These neurons exhibit shared responses across different semantic categories and acoustic similarities, such as speech attributes and musical pitch. We also confirm that these neurons have a functional impact on classification performance. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic neuron-level analysis of a general-purpose audio SSL model, providing new insights into its internal representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 8 figures.

To investigate this effect, we build a controlled synthetic retrieval task and find that a transformer trained only on text achieves perfect in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize out of distribution, while subsequent training on an image-tokenized version of the same task nearly doubles text-only OOD performance. Mechanistic interpretability reveals that visual training changes the model's internal binding strategy: text-only training encourages positional shortcuts, whereas image-based training disrupts them through spatial translation invariance, forcing the model to adopt a more robust symbolic binding mechanism that persists even after text-only examples are reintroduced. We further characterize how binding strategies vary across training regimes, visual encoders, and initializations, and show that analogous shifts occur during pretrained LLM-to-VLM transitions. Our findings suggest that cross-modal training can enhance reasoning and generalization even for tasks grounded in a single modality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICML 2026</p></details> |
| **[Inner Loop Inference for Pretrained Transformers: Unlocking Latent Capabilities Without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14759v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning architectures, and in particular Transformers, are conventionally viewed as a composition of layers. These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Singular Vectors of Attention Heads Align with Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13524v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying feature representations in language models is a central task in mechanistic interpretability. Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Highly Interpretable Prompt-Specific Circuits in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13483v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the internal circuits that language models use to solve tasks remains a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layer-Specific Fine-Tuning for Improved Negation Handling in Medical Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12498v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negation is a fundamental linguistic operation in clinical reporting, yet vision-language models (VLMs) frequently fail to distinguish affirmative from negated medical statements. To systematically characterize this limitation, we introduce a radiology-specific diagnostic benchmark that evaluates polarity sensitivity under controlled clinical conditions, revealing that common medical VLMs consistently confuse negated and non-negated findings. To enable learning beyond simple condition absence, we further construct a contextual clinical negation dataset that encodes structured claims and supports attribute-level negations involving location and severity. Building on these resources, we propose Negation-Aware Selective Training (NAST), an interpretability-guided adaptation method that uses causal tracing effects (CTEs) to modulate layer-wise gradient updates during fine-tuning. Rather than applying uniform learning rates, NAST scales each layer's update according to its causal contribution to negation processing, transforming mechanistic interpretability signals into a principled optimization rule. Experiments demonstrate improved discrimination of affirmative and negated clinical statements without degrading general vision-language alignment, highlighting the value of causal interpretability for targeted model adaptation in safety-critical medical settings.

Yet most current biological foundation models focus only on single-cell resolution and are evaluated on technical metrics often disconnected from actual drug development tasks and challenges. Here, we introduce EVA, the first cross-species, multimodal foundation model of immunology and inflammation, a therapeutic area where shared pathogenic mechanisms create unique opportunities for transfer learning. EVA harmonizes transcriptomics data across species, platforms, and resolutions, and integrates histology data to produce rich, unified patient representations. We establish clear scaling laws, demonstrating that increasing model size and compute translates to improvements in both pretraining and downstream tasks performance. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite of 39 tasks spanning the drug development pipeline: zero-shot target efficacy and gene function prediction for discovery, cross-species or cross-diseases molecular perturbations for preclinical development, and patient stratification with treatment response prediction or disease activity prediction for clinical trials applications. We benchmark EVA against several state-of-the-art biological foundation models and baselines on these tasks, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on each task category. Using mechanistic interpretability, we further identify biological meaningful features, revealing intertwined representations across species and technologies. We release an open version of EVA for transcriptomics to accelerate research on immune-mediated diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Protein Circuit Tracing via Cross-layer Transcoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12026v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein language models (pLMs) have emerged as powerful predictors of protein structure and function. However, the computational circuits underlying their predictions remain poorly understood. Recent mechanistic interpretability methods decompose pLM representations into interpretable features, but they treat each layer independently and thus fail to capture cross-layer computation, limiting their ability to approximate the full model. We introduce ProtoMech, a framework for discovering computational circuits in pLMs using cross-layer transcoders that learn sparse latent representations jointly across layers to capture the model's full computational circuitry. Applied to the pLM ESM2, ProtoMech recovers 82-89% of the original performance on protein family classification and function prediction tasks. ProtoMech then identifies compressed circuits that use <1% of the latent space while retaining up to 79% of model accuracy, revealing correspondence with structural and functional motifs, including binding, signaling, and stability. Steering along these circuits enables high-fitness protein design, surpassing baseline methods in more than 70% of cases. These results establish ProtoMech as a principled framework for protein circuit tracing.</p></details> | 29 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20997v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some training-time regularization on single training instances, without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which can be leveraged to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs. (2) Feature untangling. Compared to typical methods, due to improved training strategy, BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 43 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We introduce Control Reinforcement Learning (CRL), which trains a policy to select SAE features for steering at each token, producing interpretable intervention logs: the learned policy identifies features that change model outputs when amplified. Adaptive Feature Masking encourages diverse feature discovery while preserving singlefeature interpretability. The framework yields new analysis capabilities: branch point tracking locates tokens where feature choice determines output correctness; critic trajectory analysis separates policy limitations from value estimation errors; layer-wise comparison reveals syntactic features in early layers and semantic features in later layers. On Gemma 2 2B across MMLU, BBQ, GSM8K, HarmBench, and XSTest, CRL achieves improvements while providing per-token intervention logs. These results establish learned feature steering as a mechanistic interpretability tool that complements static feature analysis with dynamic intervention probes</p></details> |  |
| **[From Circuits to Dynamics: Understanding and Stabilizing Failure in 3D Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11130v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds underpins many applications spanning content creation and robotics. While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Make Everyone Happy?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11091v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the failure to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, leading to behaviors that diverge from human expectations in real-world settings where these dimensions must co-occur. Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication. Each prompt is paired with misaligned and aligned responses through two-stage rejection sampling to ensure quality. Second, we benchmark general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs on MISALIGNTRADE-revealing 12%-34% misalignment trade-offs across dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intrinsic Self-Correction in LLMs: Towards Explainable Prompting via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11924v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic self-correction refers to the phenomenon where a language model refines its own outputs purely through prompting, without external feedback or parameter updates. While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its mechanism remains unclear. We show that intrinsic self-correction functions by steering hidden representations along interpretable latent directions, as evidenced by both alignment analysis and activation interventions. To achieve this, we analyze intrinsic self-correction via the representation shift induced by prompting. In parallel, we construct interpretable latent directions with contrastive pairs and verify the causal effect of these directions via activation addition. Evaluating six open-source LLMs, our results demonstrate that prompt-induced representation shifts in text detoxification and text toxification consistently align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These findings suggest that representation steering is the mechanistic driver of intrinsic self-correction. Our analysis highlights that understanding model internals offers a direct route to analyzing the mechanisms of prompt-driven LLM behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Glioblastoma Tumor Heterogeneity Using Brain Inspired Topological Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11234v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prognosis for Glioblastoma (GBM) using deep learning (DL) is hindered by extreme spatial and structural heterogeneity. Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating topological priors enables the learning of morphology-faithful embeddings that capture tumor heterogeneity while maintaining cross-institutional robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A PBN-RL-XAI Framework for Discovering a "Hit-and-Run" Therapeutic Strategy in Melanoma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10136v6)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Toward Faithful Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08892v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence, but faithfulness failures, where generations contradict or extend beyond the provided sources, remain a critical challenge. Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[Interpretability and Generalization Bounds for Learning Spatial Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15199v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look promising, visuals can be deceiving. Using numerical analysis techniques, we rigorously quantify the accuracy, convergence rates, and generalization bounds of certain ML models applied to linear differential equations for parameter discovery or solution finding. Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. A similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for commonly used models, including physics-specific techniques. Counterintuitively, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also introduce a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for measuring generalization in physical systems, which can serve as a benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patches of Nonlinearity: Instruction Vectors in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07930v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent success of instruction-tuned language models and their ubiquitous usage, very little is known of how models process instructions internally. In this work, we address this gap from a mechanistic point of view by investigating how instruction-specific representations are constructed and utilized in different stages of post-training: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Via causal mediation, we identify that instruction representation is fairly localized in models. These representations, which we call Instruction Vectors (IVs), demonstrate a curious juxtaposition of linear separability along with non-linear causal interaction, broadly questioning the scope of the linear representation hypothesis commonplace in mechanistic interpretability. To disentangle the non-linear causal interaction, we propose a novel method to localize information processing in language models that is free from the implicit linear assumptions of patching-based techniques. We find that, conditioned on the task representations formed in the early layers, different information pathways are selected in the later layers to solve that task, i.e., IVs act as circuit selectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Transformers with Insights from Image Filtering and Boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10371v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Momentum Attention: The Physics of In-Context Learning and Spectral Forensics for Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04902v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) program has mapped the Transformer as a precise computational graph. We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $γ^* = 4.17 \times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility. We offer this framework as a complementary analytical toolkit connecting Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 299 pages total with supplementary material (21 appendices, 27 Jupyter notebooks with embedded results)</p></details> |
